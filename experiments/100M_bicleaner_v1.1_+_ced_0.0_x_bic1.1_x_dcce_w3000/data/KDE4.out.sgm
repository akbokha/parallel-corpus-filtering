<seg id="1">To translate the website you will find in the & konqueror; menu on Extras webpage. select the source and destination language of the translation from the list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the place of the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making it easier to access.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror, and the built-in features can be found in the manual on & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions.... Open the map tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings modules from the node; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed on your system, you may need more modules.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which is & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, which & konqueror; to crash, or drop the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The view filter module (also called Folder Filter) can be reached in the & Conqueror; menu bar with Tools pane filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website. as a default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentelement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The & FSView; for & Conqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView is to display nested folder hierarchies with the help of a tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched via View color mode, can represent either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or mapping of another file property, such as name, owner, group, or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is sufficient space for displaying or if the area of subordinate rectangle is to be used (whereby, therefore, display errors may occur due to restrictions on the character of the treemap).</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always observed. there are frames drawn to avoid the nesting of entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is possible to divide areas in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods for this are lines, columns or recurrent branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu item View View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the application of cachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the picture gallery in the & konqueror, menu under Extras Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery, a dialog opens for you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option Images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the checkbox filename of the image, specify whether the filenames are shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To view the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed among the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, specify whether the size of the images will be shown in the gallery in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file chooser Save to HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the Subfolder check box, you can set up with a slider or a rotation field to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the original pictures you can copy the original pictures to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the comment file check box, you can specify a commentary file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">For the thumbnails you can set a different color depth in the check box to set a different color depth than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under Windows navigation pane or using the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation area, and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror, which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser recognition of the & konqueror is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that reject access to browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call with the & konqueror; hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of information on the used browser and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">To check the module website you can check in & konqueror; check the menu under Extras webpage. you can check the following exams:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML, check if your & HTML; document the syntax of & HTML; matches all found bugs are displayed. with this review, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to verify your & CSS; style sheets included in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your site to further instructions and faulty links. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for the verification of your & HTML; documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web Archiver for & Conqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .html format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click with the mouse on the Tools website and a dialog appears to save the displayed website.</seg>
<seg id="54">The web-archiving module is copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlpasch @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly to & digikam; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported with the library gPhoto2. of course, each medium and each card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use this to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; Programs is also & edited; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or desires report.... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these shortcuts, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is entered here. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& gt; is a project that is supported by a community. that means that the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you questions to other users of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also check the digikam; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for announcing in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edited; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or remote folder here. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data backup is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & edited; will also use as an AlbenLibrary. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder. & edited; considered every subfolder as an album. no picture is changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can edit & edit your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Record iste to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it's possible to handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported resource cameras in the Help File Support menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly to & digikam; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported with the library gPhoto2. of course, each medium and each card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of pictures with gPhoto2.</seg>
<seg id="77">LibgPhoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules with all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digikam; to perform themselves.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal divider line or to another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to make the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the symbol view currently. thus, filtering works on the filename only when this is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single albumtree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the albums properties or by the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Import screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them onto the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can group them under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you choose to add or delete albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons oldest, average, new: these set the date for the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first select an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be contained in a collection and collections cannot be occured.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My wordlist at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures will be shown in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a short while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by regenerating all thumbnails in the Extras menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the preview. what information this is, you can edit edited, edit. select the Albums page here and customize the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help buttons which appear when you let the mouse cursor rest for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important properties including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section Introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that it was with & digikam. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can select all the features that with & digikam; you have the choice between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select Edit... Select. in the section digikam, you will find a guide on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type submenu.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image editing programs, there can be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to right-click on the preview and select Dreams. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved to the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumsliquot; organizes your photos based on the data. & edited; used for it either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with key words provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos displayed with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My Keyworlistequot; to fold the keywords that you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords are re-imported when the database is lost; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My key word; or click on an existing keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and drop there. then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking on it and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My tick quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the pop-up menu. in addition, you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you choose the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also right click on the preview of the pictures and select keywords from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have finished a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the thumbnail preview.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can use a keyword to open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only displays the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, just click on the bottom rectangle of the frame box, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click on it, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be shown again. if the search has not found, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search is done. the search function is used to assign a name to my search list in the View menu. if you want to change your selection after search, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the form will appear to enter the search again with the previously entered search information. if you choose to edit as advanced search, the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select the context menu search.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group or deleted from it. each option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., One..., No... or least... you can create searches of type & quot; AND NOCHTquot;</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one. if you push a picture from somewhere on the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & edited; find the matching pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it on the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lightable from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare, to the left or right area of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select preview synchronize from the toolbar, then you will also execute the same area of both pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to get out of a picture series quickly. if you use pair-wise navigate from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. now, use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course the normal deletion actions work directly from the lighting table, e.g. F4 File Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to rotate the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; then both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the Zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out. this happens in both images if you are looking at the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital continuance management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos performs a form of digital continuance management. most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use your pictures. we look at downloading, renaming, removing, grouping, grouping, securing, evaluating, reporting, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; digital continuance management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, fabricates and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not need to find a specific photo without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam;. the approach allows you to save metadata both in a database and in the image files, and secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive, etc; note that you will have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for that content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the Metadata Settings page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, edited a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now choose any photo keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, how you frequently call other programs, or proceed to categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically create the tree for you or insert images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are updated by & digikam; updated while the subtrees are followed.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then catch some details to see people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, associations, memories, the historical period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to generate interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the motive that moved you has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. KDE even provides a spell check. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will not tell you a second time for publication.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now moves with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolokalization are countless and will continue in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels by means of pictures with geographic data. & edited; can also export kml files you can use with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, thus also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the direction page of & digikam; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, for example in order to protect the identity of the photographer, it should not be changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's work description. examples can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here, which offers you the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image. for individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermark is unique per image. & edited; in the near future such a module will be available for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate defects, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs lost on the street or a fire. this kind of loss is the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, this careful treatment must be handled and you can no longer trust you for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your discretion room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you are just written. that's why they use a control humming mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are just effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control loops. despite this massive protection they are alerting through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said about CDs and DVDs is of course also true for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slow down with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the data again to check you. likewise, you should copy the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and in front of animals.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: diskette study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in lower temperaments, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause, SMART can not detect these errors.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make a lot of electricity, this can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious damage, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable result of a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector strip. remember, however, that not each connector also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should note that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers produce overvoltage distributions, which also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for coaxial cables of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow you even to continue working until the current runs out. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security in case of power disruptions with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can you get up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but there is no general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. it's quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer until one day. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmissions problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrf filesystem. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss on the notebook and 46% on workstations. in case of notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than for example thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorating. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not worry anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected each year by a data loss. so, backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash hits you if the drive wasn't connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget an aircraft gap: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasterprevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, a common reason for data loss despite security is the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup was made. this backup comes with a versioning system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not running continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between files that were actually changed.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topic: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, retrieve images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while the time goes by. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variations you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. do not use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing size.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability with planned and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg to see if your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of stimulus if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no more software that can be read, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (delate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is now available based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera image are, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again. they may be cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them into web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the Add a Photos to an Album you will find a description of how you can add photos you have already on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and switch it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start using the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator will appear at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from their camera into one single album in & digikam;. downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download Selected.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option Neue Download is available. in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums is displayed in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums, such as normal folder, in section My Albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & nbsp; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by deleting Delete All. if you just want to delete a few, you must first select them and then delete the chosen ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into & edited; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames in case you upload photos of different shooting galleries to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been made in the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder is automatically created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S, for example. for more customizations, you should read the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digikam, is used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced and select Auto Rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam; use this to automatically download subalbums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case it saves & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digikam; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in length and width gradients and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographite an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architects and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser with a click, which indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how does the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and finally via manual input of known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the GPX format, since this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the pre-signed coordinates that are created for example from maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you as much control over its workflow as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to set-up in the menu Options. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you specify the default behavior of & digikam; fixed when you click an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface. even with database synchronization, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for summary line: this field should contain the photographer's profession. these can be designations such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the name of the photo. this does not need to be the author, if he is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations should be registered here, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not just in the & digikam database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digikam, without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the inscriptions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to indicate which file types & digikam; to indicate which file types & digikam; to specify which file types & digikam; any file in a & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions has been edited by & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The brightness of & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. each time you open the illuminated table, these settings are switched on when possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size, you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are fixed here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling, the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more details.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can put this value on high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF option you can compress the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect image quality as the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">Save loss-free JPEG 2000 files by setting loss-free JPEG 2000 files. even if you select the lossless settings, the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, the image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently it is developing very quickly into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when white balance is not set. standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned out due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings. use the setting of transparent white in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results as it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the not yet saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstruct, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the editing options of the & digikam; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub-raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provides three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. picinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color deviation correction, since you are carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates color information and gives instructions like this one should be given back. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from one colour space to the other can be translated to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if an image is opened in the image editing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC-Profiles You have the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof Profile, which you can emulate about how to re-use your image from a device. this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can work very saturated. this could manually correct you instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for what is planned for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile Extension lets you recognize the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; image viewers and image editing support. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and these are then loaded by & digikam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes activate the metadata, respectively, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show a list of all currently supported cameras on the left. on the right hand side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. below are the port settings. below are the port settings. currently, here are Serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you select a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring them into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera, which is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can paste it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; View images in the trash bin, you can set the conversation between & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you will find further details in deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right side bar can be used silently by & digikam; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without reviewing. otherwise you need to save the changes using the button change.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display & edit the welcome screen of & digikam. this speeds up under certain circumstances the start-up of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Beim Start for new photos forces & digikam; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam; if something from the base folder was deleted, & digikam; you whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the item Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the section Bildbearbeitung.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filename, magnifying factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or button The Rerestore image processing button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action can undo you by selecting Edit Rewards or restored by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should check the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo in which you can use Ctrl, mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the Outlook menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc button. normally, the toolbar will display. if you do not want to do so, you can view this in the & digikam window.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select the Select Job Wizard from the Album menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & nbsp; main window has a sidebar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, even in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or insert captions with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are reformed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the inscriptions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button More. this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you chose a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & digikam; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom of the window is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate tick fields in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search. if additional one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag tags and drop them. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on one calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right key tree was drawn on the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off in Settings Various.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created a rule with and notice that it should be one or its, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked on & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at each point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are by email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy, why should you use a different colour space and have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limiting sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calliate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to callibrate your monitor, as sRGB assumes that you are using sRGB. the callibration of your monitor thus closes the circle. if you are working as in the colour space of sRGB, you must either set your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, please use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, synchronize, automatic reconciliation and contrast expand from the menu correcting Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminaire values across the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Like this: this method selects the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. this produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic compensation: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new addition of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited because you can work on a colour space with 8-bit per colour. if you can do so too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above shows a histogram that is changed dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels are very small Luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the controls mentioned above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the chosen color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are also set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be stored in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tonmapping can be done through the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar operation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when using a partially developed pressure a short flash light and then inverted the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally generates a negative image that so cannot be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrasteffect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusually that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can experiment to preview the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of it. all the changes you can perform can be previewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / Gamma the tool is used to improve the exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the application purpose described here. more specific the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph are three slides into which can be clicked and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left-hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to specify whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear representation is most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color ppettes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and light tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. for example, compression of output values can be used to create a bleached image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and reloaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, Medium and Sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click to preview the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminant channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicators option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode is most useful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode is further useful.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a course part to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Previewing the original photos is a red marker. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be stored in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp file format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and Sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicators option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if more than one channel is found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of & digikam; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another sophisticated tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed compared to its own horsemen.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness, as the channel blender then is THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. color-brew consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color-brew first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save any mixer setting for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicators option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2) can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, because color images can be converted easily onto the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar light scenes at the time of the day. thus, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiece: produces warm and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and re-development in a Sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a Pop Art Portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right to increase the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed one (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way of keeping his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you enter the desired frame type for your image. the picture with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), shkantami surrounds it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttoneffect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool Following aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into one image at any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the colour space and character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool templates apply you can lay a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image templates apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to diminish the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam, simply send an email in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the stencils.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the full picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically adjust the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychotropic. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process needs colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn leads to blurred edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera has often been used internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners already use a field filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool. you can call this by using the Cordirectional Folder menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can focus on more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool for softening softener softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried out. an increase in the radius or the amount increase the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, the noise and the impression of grats near sharp edges will produce.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images permit larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. this sets the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fracture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted from sharpening and thus avoid beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blurred mask. refocus usually achieves better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original torellpixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced even very strongly from the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high correlation coefficient reduces the sharpness of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss sharpness. use this parameter when your blurred line is sch. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by insharp masking a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharpness. the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied to a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the field correction methods in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothes the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The Image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen, France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to smooth smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should obtain details so that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD Rauschen will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular step width since [5, 90]: angular dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepwidth [0,1, 10]: integral stepwidth in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is low, but it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Download make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to fix image errors with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is an odd black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Hecklau.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor drivers from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">A radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the range indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to detect luminous changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication will occur again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or the spikes can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more eroded, but also conceals the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase resistance. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may occur at the edges. it can remove smoking tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected version (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften the softer with the menu entry correcting softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film bastion, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or later digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce compression: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artefacquot; - small standards that are shown in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Load do exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Finish button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restorations. this time textures have been reduced to an old colour photo, which was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by copyright of Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; in a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the Wizard with the Dark Image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the darkimage directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels with CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the darkimage will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically loads it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are highlighted in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duress: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettieri quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many centre filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the necessary shutter speed so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise blurring effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using the large exposure ranges of today's filmenand / greyscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of intensity attenuation at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer re-adjustment of exposure of the target image, let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image editing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar curved effect, but flat on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonical distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the reverse character of the parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size, resulting in a correction of first degree. negative values increase while positive the image shrinks.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tone or cushion correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best result in this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tonical correction, the effect is apparently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transformers Trimming tool or via the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tone-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as images from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page that is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known ilford (tm) SFX200 infrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option of joining film granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film baskets on your images. this is known by classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, producers mix large silver basins of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film bastion effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy look especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film bastion effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the processed image sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & edited; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the magnificence.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen for you to sketch out.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default values of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">It works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divides the picture into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similar to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the Finish button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharper: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by rotation of the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances blurring: blurred the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographed, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by accidental shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and creates it then, through the filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the Finish button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one by Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & digikam; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropp filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools can be found in the Select Rotating or Transformative Reflection menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you restore or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose the transformation size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any collection for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can last very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo blowing by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put a picture together. to cut a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply pressing the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl button for image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl + X). use the Save or File Save entries in the File menu to save the newly cropped photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="644">When cutting after aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Following aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches, or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to trim the area to crop to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the cooperation help hide help to help you put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-terrestrial angels, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that has different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussels or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquefied assistance lines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. in comparison with the Third Regel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that distracts the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above. its vertices are the central points of the golden rectangles. note that, unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equally angled triangles. diagonal to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image editing and tool-free rotation. choose Select Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transformosen cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty spaces that have arisen through transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New heights: shows the height of the new image, including the empty spaces that have arisen through transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture gets blurred. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming trim out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The activation tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using Horizontal Angle and Vertical Angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two crossings generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the image has unattractive triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath.</seg>
<seg id="685">& edited; only shows files in formats that you know. this is done using file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, it will be edited. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam; accept. in the configuration section, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia. & edited; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw picture format, you can read in English at Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the configuration section, you can find more information about how to use modules with & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to do with editing are available in & edited. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softer, noise reduction, refocusing, blurring masks, & etc;. use a unified dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture user quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphs viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz include are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphs viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphs viewer; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Posters; and & Conqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; the graph recomputes and in & kgraphviewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; open or open the graph in & kgraphviewer; in a & quot; component;</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knot and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. needs are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphs; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains just the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialogue file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file that is currently loaded in & kgraphviewer; file loaded from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item settings kgraph viewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside a running & kgraphviewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraph viewer; instance or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the already current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewt Shop page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or request the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphs viewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that every time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the ability to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphs viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not) or specify to be asked for each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which appears normally with one click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graph. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directional graphs. the algorithm sets edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & Neato; algorithm is the standard for unerect graphs. it produces representations according to the spring spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a bouncing model layout for unerect graphs. it uses the Fruitman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-link trigger for handling large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the node circular according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multi-cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as parameters, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify special options, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graphene (directed or ungerighted) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for ungerighted graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values ducrhe's own in order to select your image accordingly. look at the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scanning, wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears. please remember that the BMP type does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected the Import / screenshot menu in the Import menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen modes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select The complete desktop read to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have picked up the complete desktop, just read the window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch on other work surfaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo roll in the internet. Flickr makes it possible to show your photos to the people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module exporting to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of creating a token. this is used for your authentication. so, it is your ID to Flickr. a browser is started to enable you to login with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr web page. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the Export module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which indicates the current access permissions that the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add images should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, uploading the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during loading.</seg>
<seg id="804">With Options Public, Friends and Familly you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option Changes the size of the photos before upload, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographic data is stored in the EXIF-keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for localizing images in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic Localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the top-to-looking dialog then appears. to load a possible correlation over time and location, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file loads an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red. GPS trace data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera icon here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera distance. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these boundaries here and then press the correlate button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next, you just have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed map. select the area in question and zoom in. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a HTML page form to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise the image will appear directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you write permissions. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. of course, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnails allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production. the web browser will be started automatically to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform base operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image will be displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG loss-free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size rises because no compression of color information takes place. this can also be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please take a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create a DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. afterwards you can create the module using Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to reproduce the file on a TV, you must choose the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let them black. you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your preferences, you can start the creation of the movie with the encoding encoding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or safely enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use it later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as storage format, the metadata that contains in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to automatically overwrite the existing file. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, number and timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can resize or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-press preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo apiece. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be seen before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list and then add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images, you can use the OK button to open the New message window of your email client. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you select are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original iifdates will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diaschau module, a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation enable very elegant picture transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to own a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option shows that the filename of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option causes the presentation to be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually terminate it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select pictures randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used for the order of pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. by chance, each transition between the pictures selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments, you can use & kphotoalbum; through these browses, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the image, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you hit people with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images shown on which both persons are shown. by this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view preview images to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can store your own thumbnail, this of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right-hand side of the toolbar. in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. in order to do this, you need to open the image pane window (in more detail) and select the entry categories in the context menu. in the View window, you can customize the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog will show you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the Description field or description, the captions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either part of the total data, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window you can search all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum and watch the quick entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & kphotoalbum; start for the first time, or select from the menu Help menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then, some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try them.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; view the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane) and the time bar always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate to the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, you will only view images of this period in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can access via the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three fields of content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the moment and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. more information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without any description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. by this, those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download pictures that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images will be stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser is started after the pages have been created. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them there. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you just described have changed all three to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact that the images are stored in the file itself, or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all pictures into the file is that you can share all pictures and share this file independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file searches the images in a twofold way. first, it searches the images that are in the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">"" "in the manual" "" "Manual" "" "in the vicinity of the .kim file you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file." ""</seg>
<seg id="939">"" "with the option" "" "Automatically" "" "in the vicinity of the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you." ""</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you still want this, simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximum image size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying, for example, that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu..., it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing wizard consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window, which categories of the file to be imported, and what categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will see the different steps of (1) setting the information on your images, about (2) searching and viewing, through to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and uses this in future starts automatically. if you want to re-read another folder with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... you will get to a window where you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user manual, you will explain the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is provided that can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options dialog, subcategories were already mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group rather than all groups of an intermediary as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left window of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; it shares its module system with other graphics applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but are sold separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. you can either call them using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications are just a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, it simulates order after albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">In doing so, we simulate & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that the picture preview is showing you right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, kphotoalbum has to be released; the modules also have a list of albums. here & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category that you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category Persons, it will do & kphotoalbum; so do so, so if you have selected people to view and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and tool bar at the top of the toolbar. at the moment, it does not contain a lot of information, since you do not yet have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum is the possibility to view any picture with comments. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image was taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. for example, on all pictures Jesper is mapped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these remarks when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">Here you can see three lists with a text box by selecting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by the fact that the names used are moved upwards to find and classify the persons more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to display an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add comments to them. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S., and San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a group. to show you that it is an over-group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop it to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking the bar that forms the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window from a frame by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers you among other things the ability to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you would like to see this window again later, use the Options button... and here the window will fade out. this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview of thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have no filter. you can configure the thumbnails size by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will appear in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete Select from the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use & kphotoalbum; you can also use the images anywhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can record the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">The images showing the right upper edge are not stored on the hard disk. however, for images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so you can preview these images. you can also view these images using the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and re-copy them again. if you want to avoid annoyance on how to avoid the mess of your pictures, please buy a larger hard disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those left you want to make for others unavailable and click Current View in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister may see, control and lock the menu entry Everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item images, which will display all the images you have locked. if you want to get the images displayed again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images can be accessed from the hard drive and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them at some point. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; with a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows, of course, the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag and drop them with the mouse. you can also configure which information is displayed and if information is to be displayed at all. all of these options are available after right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see, appropriate entries to this view. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and the end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it to be changed into full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can enter the image in and zoom out. you can zoom out a rectangle with the mouse button. with the Minus button you can zoom out the plus button zoomt in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and displays the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zoomed. with the uniformity button puts the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out zooming with the plus and minus key are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the swivel functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can view the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or poorly, while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to display pictures with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in the picture you will see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have noted characteristics on your pictures, they are available in the browser. so, if you print all the images you edit, print or whatever you've selected, simply add all of them at once. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you show categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply clicking the characters for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you'll allow & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The tag is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to disable the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select On the image paint from the context menu. to exit the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; to work, you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation on & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object already selected, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button lets you remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message with error description will be displayed. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; User documentation in the direction dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as a default the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a suborder element (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a viewing level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as preset. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown to the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below an existing view, drag the tap to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the start to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the map Leaders at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to resolve a view from anchoring, drag the tap onto the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfer bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window Order... Save. it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering The Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the View scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a quick preview to fullscreen in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the picture cut for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Quality Combination panel you can select properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is the adjacent pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because each pixel is split up again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are tracked separately and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another option to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changes & Povray; the beams are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflexion computes. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray scene, select the Import menu item File Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler; not yet the full scope of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in Properties view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your document and the version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height-field data) in the paths to & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object reception of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high levels of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and thresholds. you will find more detailed information about the parameters in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. the section window instructions explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The default window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. a new order can be created with the Add button and delete a selected order with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a card card view together with the previous view and floating the view does not anchor in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and now you want to start without closer knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything without error, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to frequently use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you must remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation of & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the Apply button or the Enter key, the wiremodel views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert final body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key. in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, although at the moment only a limited final level. if you render the scene, the level expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit beneath the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens where you can choose how to insert the object. please select first subobject. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = base pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments shows just a matte black material, because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet. therefore, always remember to check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and the ball in the preview, click the Apply button and then press the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you now render your picture by clicking on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called single-color. in the color list you must enter the entry color list. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose colour each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to do this step, since you should have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input key or the user button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise the ball would float above the ground because you moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the ground, let the ball give a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on Ball Pigment, then choose Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine effect and reflection already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not at all selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options you have & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the Render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a source of light, you can see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, any scene that is to be rendered is just a few light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage have been discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last revert command. this menu item can only be selected when you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the key shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option to set preset short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove toolbars for & kpovmodeler; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to make rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with click the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching filename has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialog Configuration - & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, General and Editing and Slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the other two short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the key shortcuts can be specified for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down. presetting is not a full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this item is activated, loading & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay when you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>

<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the image, the background will also be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set up & kuickshow; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use kdialog to allow the user to know why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Start require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this purpose strings should be written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure is the script to display the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, further information about the new piece may query (for example, the metadata or the play length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle tracks the path to the selected playlist files when a custom menu item is clicked. submenu and itemTitle will also be passed to the menu to use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to perform, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archive (.tar), which can optionally also be zipped with bzip2 (.tar).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with catamark script extension. for this reason, you should properly name your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining loadable modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; append. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you may also search for a specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collective browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which ones you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just right for you. and if your decision is still difficult, dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music.

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, are saved. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible when changing the piece to keep the playlists window open / unrolled to keep the current piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok; s Appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; using proprietary fonts, the otherwise gray presented section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following range: playlist windows, player windows and context browsers. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the desired font for the OSD from the dialog. the shadow panel shade causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selections. if the color is not enabled, the preset & kde colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering space holders, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>

<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders that & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively Browse subfolders: this causes & Amarok; both the scanned and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folders on changes (for example, if music files are added or deleted). in addition, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further installation is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no further KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs thus installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a little guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD assume that your window manager will stop the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the Taglib library for days. you can locate the file by logging in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Usually this is because Taglib crashes while reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & Amarok were compiled using the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, disable automatic switch off, if inactive for... into setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens on a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but they are not labelled as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (Software Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another Sink (e.g. shosink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media needs to be decoded first. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer is reading the file, decoding it and sending the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all the others. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will appear in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also included in the runtime display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of playback buttons, volume control, and play position slide control. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. playback buttons lets you start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 pre-settings, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kds; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. however, let's not deter from the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side, the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information about the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context-browser design. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later become more detailed in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow will drop off. the information displayed there are now distributed in other parts of & Amarok. in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you will see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to see the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you will see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as the review.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in context browsers, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which one to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok; s collection database. this does not require a running text script.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First, the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further division is made after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order among each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpret - your pieces will be displayed first by genre and among them by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / interpret / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folder. if you own a lot of pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter, there is a selection box that allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. there are various time windows available, ranging from the last 24 hours to one year. besides, you can of course also select your complete collection so that the filter is switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Download - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will get the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set the pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue, so you'll be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The media player moves the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Marking the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Uplifting - Changes a record selected as a compilation of selected album back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed under different interpreters but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection that has never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Smart Playlists are possible. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist, where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The sub-window media player is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod), it needs to be embedded in / mnt / ipod before starting & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpret sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the performer list. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that allows you to get music from a given URL. for example, if you enter tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press Enter, you can listen to music in musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult due to simple dropping. in this case, the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired position and drop. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces are displayed containing the letters. to reset the filter, press the button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms OR search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found, which contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then complete the search term with goose bumps: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller searches. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something searches for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either include Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click with the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist toolbar is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to add the playlists to the playlist. to the right, you can save playlists, empty the playlist, and Random Mic.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons return and restore. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, enlarged analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you can view in the player window via the right mouse button. through this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and set toolbar buttons... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. the status for random mode and retrieval is easily changed by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. from this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Click on this entry to open the visualization plug-in window. there you can select the visualization of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The Cover Administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the Cover Management. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set one piece into the queue, the playlist will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also easily add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>

<seg id="1413">Adds tracks based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the desired playlist, drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Upload. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new one, so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of randomly mix and playlist mix immediately fill out your playlist and you can add at least one piece of playlist to your collection. the recommended tracks will be added to the next piece change, so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, activate the last possible dynamic mode: setting Dynamic Mode. this will use your existing playlist as the starting point.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kds; applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and nature of your task are decisive, which of the programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the DCOP command line, you must first make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addurls (KURL:: list urls, QString parent) void addUrl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders, and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; it is an audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are also possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and supported by many encoders that encoding these wav files (This encoder packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD, is used by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all of these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions. however, only the encoder packages must be installed which are needed. for example, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoder / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not cover the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be accessed as often as a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of the reading of a & CD; is explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Convert to many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or work completely without a network, with everything manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example, there are more information about how this program is used as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of the CD data according to the creation of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. note that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, Piepsen) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main direction dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different card cards (such as encoder, to set the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' greten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that loose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate differences are less important because both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless provided free with most distributions but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playinstruments is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--press extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires less than 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasure for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset InSane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or fetched from freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use it with & kaudioCreator; and the encoding program to generate folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; Title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters needed (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it's important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translator) is not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information publicly available on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be done harm.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; actively select a check box (Send an address). for the use of freedb it may be used with another (fake) address than the used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; for using freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which output program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more about it, look at source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the proper distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the concerned linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, more information about his switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understand everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found using a search engine, because it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg by trying to copy something into it with the Conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of & kaudioCreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (mp3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program to use the freedb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any read on a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device identifier of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing records of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The carteicard general settings. here there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is shown as left / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information requests, so that you are informed when information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second check box is easier, becomes a & CD; associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Conqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & cap; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand. to freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls boot the 8880 protocol by default, perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously missing pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore just try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to check the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, this is an adjustment for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & kde; in the event of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoding WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have cleverly selected the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is established, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is described.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different than those for a & CD; with successful data fetched by freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually instead of retrieving them from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done yet, now the & CD; into the drive that was defined in the main window must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, check the FAQ section and ask for the help section or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been successfully collected by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; a window will appear and you can select the database entry that will best suit your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step2: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the sample on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the 'Current Title' input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividually each piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words are uppercase or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the encoding settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just choose an entry that obviously agrees with the style of the released CD; in this example, this is not important since we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under skirt.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you get back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all Title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or from. make sure that all the pieces are selected, or select the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection from the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Riders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the knobs of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message shows you if you are trying to work with a encoder you haven't yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows to read and coding parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and coding. the machine used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is written in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator;, you need & cap; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & midsize window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the item from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will start automatically as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play one piece, you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tempoad and change the playback speed. in order to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two functions: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. numb the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use lyrics, others use lyrics and others. some pieces don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which one song uses, so you do not need to manually adjust the Karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select text events and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played according to the series. in this section stands how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find this in the collection below the item Organizing.... click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can choose the one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. consider this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. in turn, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opened (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When the Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu sequence of the menus collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button previous piece, previous item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General MIDI. in this case MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and lets it sound a trumpet when it was originally intended to play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Default PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define keymap "A more keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI can be mapped onto your specific keyboard. general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument need to lay on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drummal patch the patch is meant to represent a different percussionment instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas, etc;) and not the one with which the sound is the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards own).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are mapped onto a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. see for example the supplied key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to trade the first and the second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name name for this channel. of course, if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel. in this case patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM tells you that a keyboard, which gets a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, will play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; walk around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. this can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played notes. in the View menu, select Settings under the View Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without having AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all the files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to that support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I open on a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or hopped (if I want to play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, simply switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn off the Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. Randall just want to play the first file. so set the Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play for B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to gain some time for hobbies.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me simply happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file will be included (if you want to). before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and no one gets money for it. I would like to stress that I only use it because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Wesheder, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also goes to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and Karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, you can find & kmid; also found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and view images. you will also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MPlayer or Phono, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is reproduced in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the Bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive additional hierarchies. if you have an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu has to be selected with playlists from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change [General Options] No Intro = 0 based option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. if the files are ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml, the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodysuits; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" file: / / /;; / smilgt; In the directory testing / some examples of SMIL are supported by & SME;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & SMB; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'console' button in the toolbar of SME. here, the output of mplayer is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this device in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc, such as setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a flash with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & SME; it can even be inserted into the special embed embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & SME needs; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the Backend Output is within & SMB; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually modifying the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play cards from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, the need to be used and the TV channels must be used. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the SPlayer, the dialog is in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support for SME can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video-forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints how I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be executed as user root after connecting the device. it is essential to ensure that / dev / cdrom indicates the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why do my CPU have to be tested for their performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1760">Automatic execution of environments is created when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically generates an empty line (for instance\\ end} command}. this function can be set in the menu Settings box; setting up LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into several elements. & latex; allows the document subdivision into the following elements (part is the most important and subparagraph of the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating your own & latex file. once a DVI; file has been created, & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the appropriate line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the commercial output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the check-out search, the elements of the DVI; file are connected to the editor and once on an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, the corresponding section is jumped into the & latex; source code is the exact opposite of it. once on a section in the & latex; source code was clicked, the corresponding place is jumped into the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master Document: this function is used for working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast Construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file will be" "" "transmittedâ" "", "" "" "above" "", "and there is no call to & eyepiece; after the fast construction." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be conspicuous. the selection fields have been developed for the fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down box is for the fast insertion of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for the introduction of items such as keywords, merges or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"" "reference: used for reference to a specified term (select a selection field possible)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; works only if the file is attached to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are necessary editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files may also be written in & Kile; manually written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size. it can be used to define the font sizes for the main text, the merits, etc. there are the following fonts to be available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] defines the font size. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the built-in menu or the push button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; performs the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document fails, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. if rapid construction should be started & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size is created 12 and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow to change the font size within the environment â s' Giant '.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be checked within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no reduction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to achieve readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics and is as long as it is closed until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be represented italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for better readability of the document. this should include a quote, a few spots in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file was created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file, the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed with file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this, only Modern under Settings Kile must be set up... tools building can be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to carry out the search, the mouse cursor must be positioned in a row of the source code and then clicked on before search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Ocular; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Ocular; Set as text editor (Settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should there be errors in using the quick-making of the & DVI, a fault can be present. if there is an error, this will be summarised in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explains the source of error in the source code. in the editor, the simple LaTeX errors and the LaTeX errors can be used for explosions between the errors. the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears. in order to view the incorrect line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the error line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button is clicked in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty documents, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved, and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by executing an existing document and selecting a file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. as soon as the document is created in this way, the following steps have to be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can select your own template instead of the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created by a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and searched under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as an internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files (among them also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Posters; can be done in the menu directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about posters; and its possibilities to learn the manual can be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex command reference, which can be accessed over the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex, and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with a pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on the\\ par of\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pulled Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search for different types of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. this is a special kind of bookmarks within the text. the menu items Edit bounties or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; Even though & Posters; already offers excellent possibilities, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Specifies a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning is not meant to include a text with single lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only exploiting thing in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also includes & latex; commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Posters; provides the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1820">A complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description of Editing Out paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for other commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is used to jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command is used to jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to enter the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of nested ambient commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command will close the recently opened environment so that the nested environmental structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups defined by clasps {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the sharpened bracket of a & tex; group #, will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of nested loops, the overview can quickly be lost. this command will close the recently opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple indications are used in & Kile; the sign "used for two simple calls is used." & Kile; knows this case and supports two closing signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of the double bond marks can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used ad specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">Pressing Shift; input key for & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a newline break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close in a tables environment t & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with an end-to-end line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all the Et characters (amp;) among each other. by pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tabulator in the adjacent line. although this tabulator is unfortunately not the addition, add & kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already offers a good source code completion, this has been added in & Kile; three different modes are installed for different modes. all of these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings box... can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the button, the last letter of the input is removed and the default list may be grated. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from & Kile; alternatively jump marks can be added, so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible using the Edit-Trademark Tag Tag and then the desired parameters can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... boxes; can be done settings to these lists. there may be several widening lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as books of general language use can be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of completion mode will have a large e list with ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">The command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; detects that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... box; default settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of abbreviations that can be replaced immediately by longer strings. lists can be set up under Settings box... boxes can be set up. as an example of a drop-down list, the example.cwl file is used, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word misreads mode over the menu, or pressing the key Ctrl + Alt, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large numbers are not helpful for automatic execution. however, it has been noted that many books in a document are written more than once. therewith, & Kile; the completion for all already written documents.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... boxes can be disabled. here also the threshold value for the display of completion can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The execution files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphic images reflect the insertion of graphics as simple as possible. to clear the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and reorders from pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; -tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To examine the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are compiled in group style in the creation of compiling, converting and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard shortcut Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the default viewer using Alt; 3, by means of old; 4 the DVI; file is converted into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no one-in-one viewer is used, a new window will be opened every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">"" "a new project will be asked about the" "" "Menu" "" "project. for this purpose, the following information will be asked for the project:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & Kile; allows the executing of ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed across scripts in vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= box) with the following methods:</seg>

<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a sort of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (her identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for more information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: there can be an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>

<seg id="1943">Notes are simple. either the note entry from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject manager According to the area and sub-project leaders, the corresponding area or sub-project names should be given as in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up by Quanta settings... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Great / Lumpy of tags: large / lower case of automatically inserted tags. normal upper / lower case means tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal upper / lower case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>

<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and end tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic insertion of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). this setting here will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the chosen DTD is used for newly created files or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting here is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regularly backup copies so that during a power failure or crash the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documenting can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a box), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default setting at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing MDI modes and andocking / dropping views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Struggle Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area to set abbreviations (a type of templates), which will be unfolded when editing to extensive text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid, there may be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifass abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins are part applications from third party which can be re-used by any KPart-enabled application, the best known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading component in "Only-Read" mode: check if the plugin refuses to load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then save the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger Plugin drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all the holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the sound according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to deduce a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, execution continues. if it happens before a debug is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start execution of the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues. if it happens before a debug is given, the execution will start as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include is corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to go over the directive and go to the next one as if the current does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you and quantaplus can adapt to your needs and how you can help.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus. they enable & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, which & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic key of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever have.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the content of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but a folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag-folders carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declare whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain anything other than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. additionally, there are additional tags describing how to display this attribute & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which groups the elements of a list together. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be available for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end one day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neat chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; can be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus, to start and review TagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is performed only when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Machined DTD settings. this can be ediedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP file; for a newly created & DTEP, a simple & descriptionrc should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Versions 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD input. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. click New Action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the user button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), started. examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the quick start dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way tries & quantaplus; the script in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document file is removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is inserted to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script can accept input from & quantaplus. in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard output, can be specified by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it, enable dialog "Edit tag" when available to enable input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igor! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually called loose, starte, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this icon will be a & lt; startgt; -Tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. besides the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some dividers into multiple groups. set the toolbar to set up dialog by setting toolbar settings. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick access to the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by halving all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup to the right folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their toolbar (s) loaded when a file is opened from the appropriate folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like best. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to find an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for the documentation HTML files e.g. PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.html Sec2.2 = func2.html tag1 = tag 2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the section now in the & PHP documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but look at & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the section of the docrc file that serves to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be shown directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contexts separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specify it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the missing resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. in different places there is an email sending menu entry, like DTD DTD packet (DTEP) send by email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New resource you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking on OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD-package (DTEP) menus, upload toolbar toolbar, and start the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and marking. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please read the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears indicating the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tagXML format might be necessary. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP file; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Description line: the string that appears in! Doctype Tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, fetch & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand and understand the full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first acquaint oneself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. it stores everything that is marked globally, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved. this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related items are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to tool bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emofies the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and the tool bar. please consult, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with current document entries, such as closing the current, other or all card tabs, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarking or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu concerning the processed document contents, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate, navigate, open and strip information in the information on & quantaplus. in the presentation with carteiders, for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree-view are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be performed using the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of "quantaplus" is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, parts of the program, a whole website, etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can change attributes and namespaces with it. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts executed, give any error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Die & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they are shown the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before their bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure and HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus; for that be the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & society; Developer community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what has already developed someone else? thanks to the & kde; -framework is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitting actions, scripts and tool bars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is provided with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML while inserting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; writing which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Allows you to select text blocks using the & shift; key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Starting and switching of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries preceding or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents will be grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in Chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loading a project tool bar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar buttons. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be set by settings actions... added. toolbar buttons are saved by toolbars toolbar, or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from your hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; that you or anyone else made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities are to be freshened out of the & DTEP, without renewing the whole & DTEP. if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE file is not present, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. smart inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar refuses when this day contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the above menu items. clicking on an activated plugins will disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available emphasis schemata depends on the placards; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD, using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching over time may sometimes need time or unpleasant graphics. recommended is flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Addresses the behavior of the editor window. in the Documentation of & Posters; details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help corresponding to the mouse pointer's environment, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, as for example after completing the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.e..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol are used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. if you have server scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached. if a project is started anew from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact selection according to your own discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clinging out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in menu with project properties in the subwindow profiles or with Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders) that are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the profile upload profiles, upload profiles (see below) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing your own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration window, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can switch event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot be influenced at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the project menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the right mouse button context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button will be faded out to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by programmers. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsecure password on the disk will not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and tool bars. there can be many views in one project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible through Settings Toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only increases productivity, but also allows adjusting & quantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; best viewed using the toolbar toolbar. usage and addition differ. adding tool bars is described below in the Adding tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons on it can be set either using context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions can be defined, toolbar or toolbar toolbar, which can be specified, which actions on this or other toolbar should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries action and action will be displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a usual filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you set for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are normally inserted in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template-tree under global templates. more information on the Template Tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are created in corresponding subfolders. you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents, based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, combined in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template Save As local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template-tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged and dragged onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used to drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder on the right and create a site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can create header and footer or dynamically linked with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates / templates / templates / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, click on the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described before; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as parental attributes are clicked.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts to everything except the master folders in the template overview. if a root folder would be set like this, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general header lines or footer for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers by copying content templates into a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally you have a context menu (show right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor through the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; site and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to source editor when necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit, the source editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. pressing F9 is activated, this mode is already active, pressing the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is configurable via Setanta settings.... After choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection automatically the time interval can be set. basically, the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select document properties. this means the processing of invisible tags during work with the VPL; editor is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this can be changed:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in a browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change on the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using button or rangekey.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source editor. it is important to note that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed, e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted with text, any other anchors tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars such as the Tables Assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining style sheets. unlike other style templates, the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2233">A requested dipping point must be disbanded for the corresponding URI and line number. this is done automatically when loading the first template by xsldbg. the stops are re-checked shortly after the start of each iteration.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time adjusted the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if rows are only different in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders then you can make typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folner1 Folner1 Folner1 Folner1 Folner1 Folner1 Folner1 Folner3 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o Destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog notes your selection and displays them next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If collisions are crossed, the input field will be active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the Open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot extract anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences have been found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are relevant only in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is displayed on a broken line.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the header output:, the filename and [changes] if you have finished the result. usually, it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each left will appear a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing no more line is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no line in the source; this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marker you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, beginning, end, strg beginning and strg end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the dialog window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insertion button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture Up / Strg-picture Abwards) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copied. if this is enabled, whatever you mark, will automatically copy to the clipboard and copy the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use the newline + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore the next start. (menu Settings &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen typeface does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered toastert. on these systems, the button presets automatically set an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. copy the manual to the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters will not be ignored. even when merging white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\' at the end of one line, others only save a newline '\' at the end of one line, others only save a newline '\' at the end of one line, but then they may be treated with different sizes in the page-to-page comparison, although they are treated differently. while merging this option, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is passed on.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Move A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge. check for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version is appended to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Change the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need & kdiff3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is globally set over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. by activating this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding, a brief indication of what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the preview command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preview commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn on this to suppress emphasis on changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when comparing three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded overview column. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply aperture the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files together. a simple click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal post-processing command was specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command line. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line for line synchronization to convert the input to upper case: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. you can change the list by default: SED's /\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you might like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preview command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the composition from one another. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / RegExp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and merging. subsequent operations only change the data of the line interval algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the string comparison preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can use & kdiff3; complete folders recursively and merge them together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually carrying it out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, Folner1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will inform a small message window about current progress. if you cancel the scan scan, only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the folder menu contains two functions, fold up all subdirectories and unlock all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered the same when their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; after merging copies & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe), then investigate & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the same date appears, error message error: files are different, but the date is identical.. As long as such errors are not removed, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file will work after the other. it indicates the status column when merging has been successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (File or Odner), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all the merged actions (also in all subfolders), you can launch the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then the Three-folder merge mode C will be used as the target, in the two-folder merge B will be chosen as the target and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries could be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to merge only the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears indicating the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Browse, Simulation and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), a merging window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, start / restart the directory merge again or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, an appropriate dialog appears. then & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you continue merging (F7 key), a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), you will have the option to select another action for the entry, or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, the entries (in the current session) will not be merged again. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called Directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (for example * .cpp; * .h).</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the ElementTree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the ElementTree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is turned off.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be quicker to compare just the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered the same when they are equal to size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the merge suggestions are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe because it is presumed that the other file was not modified either.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .original. if an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not just merging whole folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the option directory & text windows to switch main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text windows.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder merge. to do this, use the current file merge from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be saved and the file will not be merged again if you launch the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">But this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively und.or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters need to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be adopted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modifying dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of Size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDEVPart from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, & kdiff3 assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then it removes & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select the Context Menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this doesn't work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as Part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in kPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now there are compensars) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or get it like that.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure installs in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, the lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines are next to each other, this is a more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or the ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should have no problems with compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. inserting (Ctrl-V or Shift insertion) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to reread the Refresh folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files when merging are not copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be switched off in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they are removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini-preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual worktops as well as the applications in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window within & Kpager can be moved. the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu has only the two entries to set up... and exit. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, Maximize, View Desktop and Finish. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, window within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager; the names of the virtual workspaces are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & Kpager; view the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is checked along with name, the names will be provided with file numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small window in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspaces will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default icon and Pixmap displays a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically, & Kpager; in a 2xN-grid appear, as are known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select switch-down selections... the dialog settings will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the package kdebase you will need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that constantly enhances new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnifying window. the image that appears in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is called in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & Kmag; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magnifier. alternatively, you can display a selected screen area in the magnifying window (drop-down mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note that the mouse pointer is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button down, so you can capture and move the content of the magnification window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift; key or the & MMB; use the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy to the clipboard (to add it later to other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Restart or stop the display update. stopping the update causes the CPU time to go to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointer is waiting for a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouseclick can emulate pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can also consult a doctor if this has not been done with the use of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool helps avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can fall out for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart move activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulated. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can pull the dragging with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little exercise, but you quickly get used to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This time of stay must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the intelligible shift is switched on, the turn-field shift time (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button waits before it leaves the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking on mouse postponement. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt; the first time it is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; start at any start of & kde; this feature is currently only available at & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last press.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It is best to use & kmousetool, first of all with presets. in particular, you should let off the smart move. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later increase the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which positions a mouse click does not have any effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not provide a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the reels. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scratch the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another position.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keystroke unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely to copy text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use smart shifting if you just start using the kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and click the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. by pressing the mouse button a sound like a mouse click is played. then you know exactly when smart shifting starts the shift time. later you can use the intelligent moving even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer resins. this program has been developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome and which cause pain to the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button. in this way, drag and drop can be performed using the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses news. while you & eg, you can read a lengthy text on a website, you can go with & kmouth; alerts are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order that you initiate by the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of lengthy texts that do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such one reads, this issue is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. it is delivered with predefined strings of strings such as: -) by text or for the transformation of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -reformers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are contained in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With selection filtering filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, which sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the carteicard spokesman, you can read text from KDE news about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; alert is sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up string replacement filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Replace column. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file that appends the entries from the file to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will get you with the program qdbus;. die & dbus; -numbers you have to leave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID kopete-3432 you may just enter.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string implementation filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the Diesen filter apply. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the\\ s word\\. words must therefore be limited by delimiters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>

<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including packages of kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts, refer to the source code archive for kdek or download the currently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktops, first check if speech-dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do so, you can use the Shellskript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& kde; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program ecttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech is possible directly and the script SPD-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into single phrases. the user can return sentences or abbreviations, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application specifies text to & ktts, it may specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its sex feminine, this will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen automatically. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; a speaker selects, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add speakers on the list of speakers to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the box for speaker setup will be displayed. for example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. details of the modules can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you have to enter the festival.</seg>

<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you have a long text read on a website, you can go with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, add & tts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this tab only apply to normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the output of screen readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & tts; to read KNotify messages, restart kttsmgr and click alerts. the tab card notifications appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Tick this check box to switch the reading of & kds; if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are deactivated and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard includes brands for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, voice and pitch. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice, the festival used in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100bsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-level detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single phrases. thus, only the first set can be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set limit detection filter. at the first start of & tts, a set limit filter filter is automatically set up. you can modify its settings or add further set-level detection filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the selection of speakers. switch off the selection selection and enter text for reading. check the selection of the speakers, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& tts; then proceed faster with reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text assignments on the map sheet, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit filter filter is automatically set up when you restart kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limits recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator mark (decimal code 8) to the set borders (tabulator marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (messages), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set-limit filter, you can insert it again by loading the contained file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the box selection box, you can overwrite the speaker settings for the application. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top of the box speaker). in other words, there will not be any speaker characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of an appointed speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & tts; this speaker. otherwise select & tts; the speaker that best matches the originally set of features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the desired speaker. if this property does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property has priority over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before, if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the Speaker area, which is most likely to be deleted below, click the default Speaker button and then use the Speaker which is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it's started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is down and & ktops; it was finished. probably you have to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x the command is installed-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application. when I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; a. on the & Console; appears a message saying: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts occur at ALSA, preventing simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have invited an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it at festival, but respecttsmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festival.ch. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be sox installed and able to be discoverable via the PATH environment variable. some synthesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card card for speakers. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The language settings are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML conversion filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags for converting SSML to Saber. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a own character chain replacement filter and now I can proceed in & ktts; no more set-wise pre- or reset. on the Karteireiter orders are displayed, the order consists of only one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for syntax recognition instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktts. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedestop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts during audio output. if your system also counts, you can not simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf provide the user with a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed at & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device at all allows to see and set the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up for the network hardware and other devices. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings option attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release date. by marking the setting no-re-question the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are shown in gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in system management mode, by clicking the button system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available, divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter Network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... set up in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the drop-down list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching on an outdated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the Reiters name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be placed in priority by selecting an entry and reclassification or downgrading in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the Add... from the group machine to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group machine to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known as name accounts for the host name-to-IP address reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting when there is no DNS server available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains some well-known hosts some entries that support & apos; localhostapos, and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple alias names, de button Add multiple times and enter the alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry from a name that is known to name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Concrete Calculator will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Setting module are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, you have to set the following command.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home-) network is communicated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread distribution. from IPv6 it is expected that it is going through in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, at & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact person to enter a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can not be used as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are mostly used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.015; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the standard route is needed for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified dynamically at DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which also provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included in & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; press the tape back and read the prestressing information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't know the preload on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the preload, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the bandindex is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the Status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">Tape types need to be formatted before you can use it to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat; this process requires formatting before using & kdat. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of tape, DAT drives are not formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with formatting the tape continues. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be backed up. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select the Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog box opens for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Once you have confirmed the settings, the backup will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu item...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the verification process has been started, the dialog will appear settings for checking. in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog box will appear for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will appear again. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can add the index to two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">As a result, a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be backed up is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device file for tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is involved, the command will load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; block the ejection of the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the release of & kdat will be disconnected; automatically ejected the tape. do not use this option with floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; the hardware file size for the tape drive is changed. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The tape ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>

<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, features & ksystemlog; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog will try to open the system protocol - the system protocol - it will not appear, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with System Administrator rights.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string. add a string to the filter bar. the list of log messages is now automatically changed, so that only the log lines are displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line is displayed only if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter search term will only be matched with entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and then insert the name of a process in the filterstrip, then show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines sent and / or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. record lines of level errors are displayed with a more striking color as protocol lines of level hint. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off in direction dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can view the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu, in order to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kd; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for controlling program start-up during the boot of the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not deal with historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc This is important because maybe someone could try to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. so you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc This folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to run when you run the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls are according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run something that has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in various places according to the init program and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can manually edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you can fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; I could also have a user runlevel, which & gt; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand tool is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six runlevel to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else. this will only happen if you remove an entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to enable the various working ranges (Verfügbare Systemdienste, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry, press the button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered from & ksysv; changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runways, and now the machine is constantly relaunching. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions simplify configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without a message if their configuration files are not present or set up incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either you can use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save item in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog User or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card is created where you can make individual settings. more card cards appear if they are installed shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management card appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if there is at least one restricted filesystem space restriction (Quota) and is initialized (recognizable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the File System File System with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The groups of cards are informed about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog Properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group, or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, modify operating systems, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
