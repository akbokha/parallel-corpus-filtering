although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run their sports .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter covering the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil @-@ magnet with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who had his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal letter of love about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never stops the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in flocks .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party ever .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Program , which takes people from all over the world , a profound believer with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung , too , did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she is still adapting to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew treats , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp made his way to the nom@@ inees republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps because of its cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
but you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . Ü ) : as much like &quot; white against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; word@@ play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has made so magnificent .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality - it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who &apos;s not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that &apos;s Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; from C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ den violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with recycled instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er started to convert parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all produced from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world produces about one billion tons of garbage .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in li@@ berian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
correspon@@ dingly , the East African countries were upset and reluct@@ ant to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior manager of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship in time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the region &apos;s waters : it didn &apos;t manage to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia because of pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , who then expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and support each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while action against illegal fishing was once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen in real time , tra@@ trac@@ table at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious driving routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is charging its caught fish on its way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal offen@@ se .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then , on the basis of this information , deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced into the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company that advoc@@ ates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already @-@ called platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million in lost revenues , which lost eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of fanta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately util@@ ise the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could be fishing illeg@@ ally and a land could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot walk my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
because of his co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal @-@ operated vessels with greater precision .
a model program
yet , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed globally through the position of each tracking ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what &apos;s going on - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them .
ships that previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly had any consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have a 33 % increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; six countries joined forces in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with certainty , the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also steep@@ ed in forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pedi@@ ment of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the minist@@ erial resolution , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void , were gathered on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the Bar@@ inas region , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the Federal State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the official release of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but eventually the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the decision :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine has been the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( such as the round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for the majority of representatives of the opposition after the 2015 elections .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike , and on November 3rd , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; the Re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator who cries through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries this Vene@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter pictures , which tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially large waves struck the news of police suppression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round , which forms the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial disclosure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your official release !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , did little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and preferred to let critical voices be stopped :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing ever more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
from the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years old , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Sec@@ retariat of Intelligence , 141 at La Per@@ la .

archive recording .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everybody called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called on me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have bor@@ rowed from ERP .
pass on merely that they will not guide you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
that &apos;s why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be secret .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had educated me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I looked inside and saw a couch folded on man .
she looked like a cot and metal feathers .
later I found out that it was mounting the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was bound there .
they seldom bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shoot him with water , and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the smell there was terri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was placed under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried away .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - they were all tied to hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people were silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told them at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to figures from survivors , the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , passes through the former torture chambers .
the path that you entered here is also the path on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look on the map , you see that they took approximately this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - eu@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; Battle of War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time , at the age of old , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one fought against an enemy that one fought .

but when one walks into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then that is not war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who keep cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded rage , beat me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
this is how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . I had both my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vile act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why did the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their corp@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families with whom you could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were ground and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains forever .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed aw@@ ful crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then I tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I paid the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 most severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 The oppressed were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court sentenced lifel@@ ong imprisonment and in nine cases sentences of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research was 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , last month witnesses of a very special mis@@ fortune translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was wrong@@ ly mistaken - but perhaps also with malign@@ ant background than@@ king &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local newspapers attentive .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faulty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate even if gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) were replaced .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , it stated that the error was already contained in the text it received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are involved in accidents across the country , is a reason to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the specifically not @-@ named repor@@ ter brought comments to light in the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error received among other things the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So wrong is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers should be .
for example , a French native speaker should translate the French into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , who could make translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who want to learn Japanese .
some companies , who have no foreign employees , can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
automated translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences produced by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship in the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer available .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was ch@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again blocked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ oms threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a call for violence .
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online tran@@ smit@@ ters .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS server requests specific domains in@@ correctly .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server will reply or deny the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked canal , was posted on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried out the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was detained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia coverage on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers testim@@ onies of other cri@@ adi@@ tas , which became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a spa report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , which are edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ating from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes her minor son or her minor daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be made - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees in general silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family that their daughter in the belief that they can complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl with herself and justi@@ fies his exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it until many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the sec@@ rec@@ y of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra passed on to Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply involved in the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest r@@ allies and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; says Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case occurs before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be trend @-@ setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go occurs in court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , she puri@@ fied the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time for learning .
the more she finished learning , the more leisure time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could get more books from the library of the house than food from the refrigerator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the owner of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her not to give any faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered it intelligent , but didn &apos;t stay with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often allowed me to visit my family because they believed that I would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed her to lose again , she explains .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a municipal coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town Ñ@@ u@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came out of Ñ@@ u@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the stor@@ ef@@ ront of the ad switched on once again :
dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ? cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies from former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Early History of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the wives of Guar@@ an@@ í , were ens@@ la@@ ved and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination was given to them ) and the system of the Men@@ ú ( where the workers were considered to be semi @-@ slaves ) , and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , with which they become light sacrifices for abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and that for the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill design@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently approved a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ulations concerning the Use and Use of Social Networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up to be commissioned to grant citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it failed to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill consisting of six articles and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video viewer and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation Department and password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research technologi@@ sts &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I have no doubt about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
when I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens that require a permit or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court of justice .
this is by no means realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in accordance with a pro @-@ military mode of thinking in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the surface , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the parliamentary deputy , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those who are guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threatening public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the article is published here as part of an agreement on content sharing .
high above in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that ro@@ b through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this certain le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the flour@@ ishing of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately showing a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to establishing protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years in re@@ building the lives of those affected by the &quot; Triple @-@ Cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
to this end , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) were completed .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accounts for 70 percent of the final light .
nevertheless , one still endeav@@ ours to reloc@@ ate evacu@@ ated accommodation in the final replacement houses six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by accommodation establishments ( to the most part , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) .
after the triple catastrophe almost 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in accommodation establishments .
in December 2016 , more and more 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people were evacu@@ ated to final homes after disaster .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma can be re @-@ used again .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farm@@ land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far behind .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it seems more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how their reception changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed think that there has still not been enough of disaster prevention .
how it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused on the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture also witnessed the worst , disa@@ strous , atomic accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been converted into permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that it connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over speech and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ita explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active ministry until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a polic@@ eman was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire suppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also bath@@ ed in social networks .
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who has beaten him into the face with a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist .
police raid gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which last Friday there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
polic@@ emen were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber missi@@ les and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to abst@@ ain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window in order to make their titles illustr@@ ative with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Villa@@ ges forgotten by the Ent@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso &apos;s law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as the el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no matter that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after planting the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its plants until the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves anew .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te to the factories daily .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who arrives at 4 : 00 every day , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back into operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became intol@@ erable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , published according to the 2016 report &quot; Land economic perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing date , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of official written documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ ress@@ sat and the date .
all of them were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he asser@@ ts .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ sheet producer has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the workplaces and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to dis@@ mount it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they became parts of spare parts .
without the prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine people gave the old soldier a rent of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that you told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to retirement for 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do this by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop managers have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the ped@@ ago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in north @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop thus increases the young participants in talks like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of T@@ ears , a road section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ enlightened .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always control the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe , who gave them a stop@@ per in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will take our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how she lives a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as well to our youth
so they can do what they have intended for the Creator .

in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by every dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend now turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food processing is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the compass .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a and salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon che@@ ating ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone support has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and rib@@ bons made of dried salmon .
you can look at further bizarre plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # of the ...
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reporting on drug dealers such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each corp@@ se , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug trafficking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were fighting between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organized crime is not only concerned with our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her ne@@ ph@@ ews only one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I &apos;m now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but you don &apos;t get them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership of the state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known disease and sensation@@ alism for a few years now .
I &apos;ve come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ pt those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wat@@ ered down &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not touched and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family was sack@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month for month until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain over it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report in the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation signed by Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and makes &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies living with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody corp@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor was 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8,5 mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this contribution and the pages to which he links contains pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to un@@ equi@@ pping a rum@@ or or to expose fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release it has been used irre@@ versi@@ bly to convert trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong combination of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to the victim .
authorities &apos; representatives described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie nearby which was full of people watching the football world championship .
houses burned and char@@ ted bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ ted bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here history is not its end .
over the years , the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what has not happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically about the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a local people to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ ad@@ missions ; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings .
even a step further , personal comments like this example fal@@ sely precip@@ itate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations described those who could flee blows , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared as the following , which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this image comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein said , monks and politicians participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the picture from the DR Congo to view this information .
the original fee , which was accessed last April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations that named AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein Sein this statement , but had not taken the picture out of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false links date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by means of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can transc@@ end borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures in 18,@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mass of private sites , social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , some others tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which page they had been published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by the language itself .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked together ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
case studies of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to sites or servers that are still available through the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or false noti@@ fications .
the grey countries are examples that according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye will probably also show counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was presented as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one tweet , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , legi@@ timi@@ ze , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a book on what it has as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos taken by international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correction , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which directed itself to the members of the Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am published by An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , now deleted from the Catholic Church , has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture came into circulation later in the context of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo pi@@ cks up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it un@@ subscribe .
from the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ ese missionaries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated himself .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately we@@ ars a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions on silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that rej@@ ecting images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers , and emp@@ ower them to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media work on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fake news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they will need to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which a picture may suggest something , which can actually be replaced by the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. inv@@ alu@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these unmistak@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example words from the language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Pain@@ ting you for your parents in recognition of how you have tried to care for yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other ways of thinking and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wines here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people were missing because of the floods and mud winds .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been evacu@@ ated to 30@@ 4 safe places of stay .
the rainf@@ alls slow@@ ed down on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are ready to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 number .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if you need assistance in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for collection of assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key that resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ d@@ water and land@@ slides .
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring people in need in security and afford aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
Muslims , which cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March 21st of January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and my dear friend .
I trust in her my four years old daughter ; she trusted in me her children : she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next year , we apply rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , tied out of an American flag , others sk@@ ate slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they have reli@@ ed on me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me , do not fit in , have to be m@@ apped .
to be reli@@ eved
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures do you get into the mind when you think about him ?
love ?
to be on the road ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , just as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a large part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ covers the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to worship them .
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here by slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has taken our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Si@@ kh &apos;s and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations that help us understand the world .
and my industry has f@@ abul@@ ously failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first decorative design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re @-@ imagined the world sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ challenged Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or wearing my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ans with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be a the@@ ological expert to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information that our already fla@@ wed image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , has manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head@@ scar@@ f .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam hos@@ tility in its ugly forms acc@@ uses our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ial church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I am a Muslim when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I kept her silent in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s poses .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; as they gain a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings by Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can practically mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that - over the centuries - was col@@ oni@@ zed by a &quot; Empire &quot; which a company has founded with the name Ehr@@ lich British Ost@@ inev@@ eh company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ asch@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ le@@ ashed around his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he had not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at play risk .
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all except four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled into more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion things go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our in@@ born history .
it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of war .
being an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects we@@ ave a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination attempt .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Muslim schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple lines , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ars who began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officials who take up a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders with people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely addresses Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw down on Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically wrong picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to sof@@ ten the Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the bad and dangerous prints that we con@@ sol@@ ate in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global time point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who have made me a Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evoke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may be l@@ ur@@ king where someone is made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam hos@@ tility take place .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be fought and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance , four decades ago became a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously j@@ aw@@ ing the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I present in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , which feeds already broken countries and &quot; to other &quot; man @-@ made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not based on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been organising events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is associated to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to listening , to appreciate , to touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will first present their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience is att@@ un@@ ed to it .
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ in@@ ara tells the cable of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ o@@ ons in Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his cable , John Ny@@ am@@ in@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS to organise their own story narrative tours .
Rico calls for re @-@ establishment of sovereign debt by the US
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to $ 72 million , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the An@@ de@@ can@@ ese Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos;s Front for the Ne@@ ural Testing of D@@ ebt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests on public debts , with a fixed remuneration corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the country &apos;s sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation , proposes a law on social responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires extensive restructuring of state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imposed by extern@@ ally imposed measures without the participation and conviction of citizens will be liable to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ing de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of book S@@ prints , produced copies from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Post@@ al Research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of essays dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what is the real cost associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what did we give up in this process from time @-@ to @-@ time extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , was transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad administration and they were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , its place of stay and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently crossing the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pro@@ vision@@ ary than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 to her husband when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and words
who I wear with passion ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I am persu@@ ading myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
while at the same time
I &apos;m in your cage ,
and you are still in the box of monsters
Bas@@ sels &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , a minimum of 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison by 2016 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope we have to do this last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption den@@ ounced director after release again on previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants in 2010 .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not call the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to restore the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate disciplinary proceedings against the infrin@@ gement .
the company apparently was silent however and did not make reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contradictory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half off .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to become re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to be paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I cannot believe that one was rewarded in such a way that the state had already so massi@@ vely offen@@ ded .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become we@@ ary of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long imprisonment .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered for the Mos@@ ambi@@ ans as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral presentations was , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes tactics but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rej@@ ecting :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and was released .
and today the company , in which he promis@@ ses money , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ λ@@ ι@@ α ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
in fact , in # Mos@@ ambique to be th@@ ief and atten@@ dant of # F@@ rel@@ imo , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long life imprisonment , returns to # Air@@ ports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East India origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely rejection con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basically different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ni@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
but he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to ease his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the phrase ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question face ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to fac@@ e@@ ook .
what should do instead is to carefully analyse the post and control it by checking the words of the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spac@@ ers ) .
the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists who dissemin@@ ate hate language have a fairly good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to cut off their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the action may send a strong signal to all who broadcast hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his views on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring even more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also appears as if they started doing this without local context or technical support and banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great deal of turnover , it would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided plenty of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain a hate language but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where arguments between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the spreading hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of just cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learn from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the kids
a wedding ring in the sand .

the he@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
prior to this change in the marriage period , several members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , said that the state should not interfere with the state , since that is , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children under 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married in 15 were in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 , it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at abol@@ ishing laws for children followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to say to the critics of the children , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and eventually doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country has to agree and let the law announce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s broad@@ cast@@ ers gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for that and no one against it .
having previously been approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thrilled , because the laws on child@@ birth had finally been amended .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dresses a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the heart of the matter , but know what ? the he@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Out@@ going news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foli@@ age Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the amendment to the spouse &apos;s network was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there were 41 dep@@ uties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who were opposed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the baby @-@ toe is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # index marri@@ ages .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ uties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take court steps , the law was to be adopted , and he seems to un@@ le@@ ash his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users desired , one would approach the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion in general , in a way that can only provoke panic and arrogan@@ ce , if we , instead of speaking of the problem , would simply say that the state that protects our daughters from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are compared to them , &quot; would you be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ News to the local news service that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can re@@ visit Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia site was presented internationally on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based En@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful as well as reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using stra@@ pping tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 took place after the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several M@@ irr@@ or@@ Pages ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) have emerged .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available , despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we took all the sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in distributed and distributed ways .
this can help users to at least check all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ sites when Wikipedia is banned in the respective country .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as collabor@@ ators at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) inv@@ oked me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started cra@@ ck@@ ling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une Nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know it , for he was already standing face to face with tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he strai@@ gh@@ tens immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une Nature and Wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to speak the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ oti@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with great care avoid speaking the name of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of their social pressure , they should respect the husband as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the standard of keeping this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a pseudo @-@ court and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives is also common among men . however , they have far fewer ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health workers and house@@ wives , entered a unique club and became quickly the main subject of the city .
it is a place for them only where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS , and leads this club .
it tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her panel discussion was of women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves .
to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands lou@@ dly , is a custom that they all owe and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband so far , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ak of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she smoked just before herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their saying .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another member of the club decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the tin @-@ red dot if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their life they celebrated their birth@@ days with cakes in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought of before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never spoken so honestly about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sage Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , the morality linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of c@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry it .
next , they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion decision , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have done only little steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including myself , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am there too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29 , this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , observed the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . they were only 51 years ago here in Tokyo .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pupp@@ et John L@@ enn@@ on is to represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places related to the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! the today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could that be for a day ?

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of people for organ trafficking , presumably for non @-@ faith purposes , troubled the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country carried out a mission in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight against these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police warned about the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably off @-@ believing rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in the last days three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the major social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ IG@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ MAN E@@ IN Mozambique , THE S@@ ICH ashamed A country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , and would not viol@@ ate their lives or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for un@@ believers or &quot; black magic &quot; will be hun@@ ted .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter bene@@ fici@@ ary , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
the Muslim authorities are very worried about the assass@@ inations of bald people .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad .
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government shared that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , since exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling upon China to release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest without delay and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an Declaration on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States - Ypages@@ US@@ A@@
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message promp@@ ts the Chinese authorities to not only release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. embassy sum@@ mons a fur@@ ious response from China , with the expression of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to intervene and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the following to the couple :
protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government forward to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great doubts as to whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with anyone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to permit enforcement of these rights .
France - France
France &apos;s State Department requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those seeking peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ gi@@ ver Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to permit the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried about Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore was to be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city to be considered .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of it , it seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the main point of the topic , the good old body appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers to be Democrats , leaving the twisted logic , because it is better suited to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system , really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he tar@@ red related questions with non @-@ answers of a rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clear this point , provided he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
while An@@ on published his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the whole message of the conference to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the head@@ line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of those cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as a leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said .
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is correctly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not defend their city ?
who must our prime minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to become Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many of the people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world to be revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the most recent part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication then follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly with anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being referred to as &quot; nice , &quot; basically means being sp@@ ie@@ di@@ ly - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really was a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things happening around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justi@@ n Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Colour band describes a young man who tells the prescri@@ ptions of his girlfriend .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially regarding the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persi@@ sted over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which grants absolute decision making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are seen as critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors and monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand is committed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Disp@@ ens@@ ation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car before bringing them to an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers very slowly in east @-@ west Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , South @-@ East Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the region .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have now abandoned the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the laps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave to Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden or house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembered the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten once was , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was at first a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it tends to do something with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as they were right .
I remember every day how the city and war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy conf@@ esses us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball rolling .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ genu@@ ity in their lives .
they do not know it otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in Ted@@ dy B@@ ears form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez re@@ counts , the people come in full bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on their way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then to move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ etti , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses , the travellers can consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones calm@@ ly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter &apos;s daughter with African hair lichen she has made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she puts her in front of me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by t@@ witter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a conservation service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in distant , troubled ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; images from mainland China &quot; based on Twitter , which cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked the residents , whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use appliances intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can highlight the password requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and party related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police station .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane depic@@ ts his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where all the important things have disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to its name .
one that has reflected in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality brings you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear to you that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough so that I would learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security minister formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put any high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find them together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment you become aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
the colon@@ el of Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el of gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to shout when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re sorry what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret any word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his Father is like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smell of this cur@@ sed proposition lies to me today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I &apos;d like to take a look at all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they have all@@ otted to me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner and may immediately put me on without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , feeling like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I went back to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : to strike against the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the complete darkness there are no signs of a striking sight , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers den@@ ote his existence .
perhaps he was transferred into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ uring to the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was venti@@ l@@ ated : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to reply .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly chat have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I did not do anything to make this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the clo@@ cks .
your hang@@ man rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold your cry back .
my cries were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a waste collector sooner or later , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the hang@@ man noticed the cooling down and did not have any pleasure in it , which is why he approached an electrically charged rod .
current flow through my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry fear@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he s@@ lows down to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belongs to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who poses the conservative majority and questioned her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man &apos;s relevance , but also in cities that extend from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he has a special en@@ vy against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he has dissolved in water Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a da@@ zz@@ ling hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the slu@@ gs of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighboring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the well @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la praised the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to advocate for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply sil@@ ly rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an ever more obvious emerging reality in Jordan that appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional sex men by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently d@@ ashed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust .
in recent years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able mur@@ ders &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary kill@@ ings reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , it is still surprising that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime from the year 1954 women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that are long considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics was in@@ timi@@ dated by politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are in essence politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse repe@@ ats quite often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program , Ro@@ ya , to mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn , distorted and cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only an edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service held several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they had critical comments in social media to the problems related to the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is , according to the opinion , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied a performance for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s how it looks like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will embrace a genuine and fundamental openness through music , art and literature - and not by bombs , scattered uni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ induced demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until it reaches far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to tow and therefore resist@@ s resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the ball@@ ads , drums and dancing were delivered over more than a thousand years ago and come from a time when armies mar@@ ched from western Japan to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two trol@@ leys are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall carriage was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and razor blades

rarely external appearance and body care were as important as in this history , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are common .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru experienced - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more regular citizens into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against bar@@ ber tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers instead of bad advice .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year started in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of Love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation did not go beyond their heads and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la pra@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla occupation F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , forming the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be as significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bian people there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would close together and help in the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - who then should be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need much more need .
he plans to share his love with people who needed most urgent attention this year .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members set themselves up as they had done before to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies between them , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ eras &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty Sle@@ eping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life has anyone written such a beautiful thing , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly my tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already at war and the F@@ ARC acted already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State had looked upon the whole Colom@@ bian people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no right to vote , and to recognize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and have done so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colum@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ qualities , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are ready to resort to weapons , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also totally justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with horror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat posed like a women &apos;s threshold about the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not yet been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that address the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the Ch@@ echn@@ ya authorities &apos; methods of det@@ ecting suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that in reality she was a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned from the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
in the end , she moved out of fear for her life in the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a acquain@@ tance of D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her up without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which patient were you laid - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there &apos;s still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they said absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by going through the streets above ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ sn@@ y on the official television and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad things , and Photos@@ hop .
I have basket size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has broken not only your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to my mother it became too much and she put a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked out the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering without proof , without it all .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived at and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re in security just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equ@@ ation , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ us elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually try to see how the person looks , to which she is reminded of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who are dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for that , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock out a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
I mean , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person affected and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there is not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are captured there , so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ ate themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ards had grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was there even when these people were taken along .
up to now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already known all over Gro@@ sn@@ y before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in the grave !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now .
Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of security of Sh@@ aria never hurt me with just one hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mock not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply shut their eyes in front of you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row went to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it for a long time .
I have discovered these people myself , when I ap@@ plau@@ ded the type of refuge .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you sweat in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys in them .
the D@@ age@@ stan@@ ers have who , the cab@@ ards , have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , such Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community resi@@ des in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of spon@@ ges to diver@@ t water from the Arab territories to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have led only to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youngsters now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director of cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist based in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
because officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists are beating alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be women .
for example , in spite of the same education women still earn less money than men .
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , black women women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ lift their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background tend to be referred to school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all men , have the same rights any skin color ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take account of injustice in her mind , which refer both to the gender and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women forever and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ised and margin@@ alized creature in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups which , moreover , absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming , says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and where the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .

in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video was filmed , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , poorly understood sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ ative . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a Police Commissioner , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ spouse , who had been violent to her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to abuse , the acute ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was also useful .
a few days later , the second wife pulled her ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ever visit an ad , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities .
contents 1 Be@@ atings and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not prohi@@ bit Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , inadequate implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements went to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too , 86 % of the ads of women came .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do so are coming to any woman who will not do so because of physical abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed by their current or former partners each year .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 women &apos;s murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she had to regret it . this should always regret it .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most noticeable :
I never thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long enjoyed Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Nicht@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare Fem@@ izi@@ d an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the legislative text was modified in a number of respects to also gain dep@@ uties for the law , which advoc@@ ated that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they simply place ad and want to obtain a safe accommodation to state the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay ill @-@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed before , among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman remains subject to attacks one year after the ban on a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , but were later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having served his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , along with his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially the secret service , the freedom of the press , including press freedom , and torture , in@@ timi@@ dation and torture of human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s newspaper , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported about corruption in Oman since its foundation in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , took note of an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties to bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS in front of the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS was appointed chief editor , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper on any road , including online , is prohibited on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final shut@@ down of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned for dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on the publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &quot; imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ uan Ri@@ al ( $ 7@@ 800 ) . moreover , a one @-@ year ban imposed on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 USD ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for distributing material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5,000 om@@ uan Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , and sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government of the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order that extended the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister ordered another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman are unable to carry out their right human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , but it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists itself helps build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
AG@@ A : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being makers themselves .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
AG@@ A : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
AG@@ A : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
AG@@ A : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a researcher in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here .
the system that magazines can only be made available against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of salad he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ch@@ illed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or car@@ rot varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition Mort@@ on is still breeding a salad , but he now needs longer since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to bl@@ unt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful , however , and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that gets bigger in the US and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salad of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative called Os@@ si , US @-@ breeders can commit themselves to the fact that other seeds bred by them can be freely used .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; gro@@ wers only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
Professor der University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new crops , both in food safety and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to exploit the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , as it is offered in August and September 2016 . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seed free . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , an executive director of Os@@ si , has found herself in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about a third of all flash@@ cards are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant breeders to be usable at all or even more difficult .
for other plants there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even larger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such , by which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point to the fact that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predictable due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker &apos;s C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property advoc@@ ates other breeders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not hin@@ der innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , there is certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost .
the main argument for Mort@@ on , however , is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the whole , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics ourselves .
the plants make it self @-@ sufficient and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are needed mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides , cultiv@@ ates in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly gent@@ ri@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on also believes that breeders are more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I need a new material for my catalogue , because I know my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which you think it &apos;s pretty easy . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre co@@ operates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Os@@ si &apos;s obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the Os@@ si commitment cannot simply be one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , has declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . this speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law yet ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start @-@ up should be scheduled for next year .
an association of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report published by the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has focused mainly on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still locked up content on the internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above .
in August , the Network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information - despite this attack and the ridi@@ cul@@ ing of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who actually defend the law , have never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to yield . we insist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of wave of website closures fell victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , who is also home to the Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in prison after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the block@@ ade by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of del@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , a attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence , even though only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers by changing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
she reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s has been offering began .
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention of continuing to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by means of which it can proceed in court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers in all Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ olds shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and air port to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , announced that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a martial art in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues to call the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold accoun@@ tability in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rates per state , Rio is up to No. 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is an extra member of the company , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policies also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , however , U@@ PP has become increasingly under fire after several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civilian is a rough point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lost spheres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war sooner or later , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week it is now that the police cl@@ apped the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed on the basis of the United Nations investigations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels have been under siege outside Damascus , which meant that local residents are dependent on locally produced food or food smu@@ g@@ gled through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become in@@ accessible to large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are very rarely part of Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and reli@@ ed on his relief that it is gaining more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article &apos;s Constitution , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 04 , 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger bathtub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i anywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking down the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residues ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many cities of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower .
bran@@ dies were also registered in Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ works that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in 2017 alone in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos spread in the network and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &apos;s paper :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened as in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned .
a wide @-@ ranging proposal on the Wal@@ dre@@ form which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val carries on in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread to the fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the civil defence website of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative , which provided the people with information : they used their own civilian data protection data with the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so instrumental in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stick to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million acc@@ esses .

in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n fac@@ tions , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .

in the morning the boy was supposed to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Pakistan .
a couple of years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than himself in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there was no service there and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high welcome quot@@ as . however , it is also true that the conditions governing asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers under a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre , if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions .
having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af placed all his savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years , some of the companies operated by Afgh@@ ans have been created , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a Pizzeria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets extend far beyond the Italian gastronomic trade and retail outlets and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ging plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in custody for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that provides users with social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users would have to be able to use social networks , within six months of their successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identity number .
whoever missed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the un@@ ending of a criminal payment .
the law , which has been promoted by 60 members of parliament , is currently available to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another Member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er sanctions would be introduced for the insul@@ t to the President or a senior civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the president and state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . however , under the law of law , such an act would however be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts from Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
as more than 700 protest participants who were arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in jail for a court appointment .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light of among others weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist li@@ stens to scann@@ ed documents
may Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , which would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they return all the illeg@@ ally received mon@@ ies .
the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website on 21 April sheds light on how the presidential plans look for supporting the template .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on May 09 .
does China want to force users of social media to submit their identity ?
according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share news in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rules it is also stated that registration will be required with full real name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to select these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the provincial government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the publication of information . the law also allows the government to make certain services responsible for the removal of content and to force it upon request for the termination of user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the particulars , Turkey support jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to promote a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install remote programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . responses and proposals from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
