<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run their sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter covering the murderous plot of an oil-magnet with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who had his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical letter of love about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never stops the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in flocks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Program, which takes people from all over the world, a profound believer with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung, too, did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominees republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps because of its contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt to those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (OB. Ü): as much like "white against all the other ethnicities," wordplay from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has made so magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality - it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "roared the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they shouted and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who's not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" from Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces is known for its abuse of drugs and banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recycled instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler started to convert parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all produced from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music all around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">Correspondingly, the East African countries were upset and reluctant to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused" "", "Benedict Kiilu, a senior manager of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship in time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the region's waters: it didn't manage to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia because of plundering the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, who then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "they exchange information and support each other where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. this makes illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while action against illegal fishing was once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen in real time, tratractable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attends the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. also, suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is charging its caught fish on its way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then, on the basis of this information, deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced into the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile any more." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company that advocates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already-called platform was created to recover estimated $20 million in lost revenues, which lost eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately utilise the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could be fishing illegally and a land could then say" "" "You cannot walk my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and just this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of his co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross them," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal-operated vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet, FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organisation: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed globally through the position of each tracking ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what's going on - this simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project where a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without a license and hardly had any consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have a 33% increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "we have become a study object." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "six countries joined forces in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "with certainty, the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also steeped in forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works throughout the world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>
<seg id="152">Their articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to escalate: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of "conquering the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the impediment of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the ministerial resolution, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void, were gathered on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recovery of Venezuela), both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country, including in the Barinas region, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-north of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the Federal State of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the official release of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but eventually the holding of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the decision:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine has been the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (such as the round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called for the majority of representatives of the opposition after the 2015 elections.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike, and on November 3rd, all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="170">The first demonstration in the context of the action programme "The reconquest of Venezuela" took place on Wednesday, 26 October.</seg>
<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen as well as advocates of the government.</seg>

<seg id="177">Especially large waves struck the news of police suppression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards don't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round, which forms the scale of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a ministerial disclosure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="189">Others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which, from their point of view, did little against the disastrous economic crisis and preferred to let critical voices be stopped:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing ever more in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities of La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">From the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years old, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Secretariat of Intelligence, 141 at La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everybody called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called on me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who made the local newspapers attentive.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, which are involved in accidents across the country, is a reason to worry." ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate the French into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, who could make translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who want to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who have no foreign employees, can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automated translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences produced by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship in the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups, resisting the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was chapped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecoms threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a call for violence.</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS server requests specific domains incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server will reply or deny the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third locked canal, was posted on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more and more difficult to access multimedia coverage on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series titled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), which are edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before graduating from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes her minor son or her minor daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be made - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Criadita guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," "" "explains Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family that their daughter in the belief that they can complete their training, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl with herself and justifies his exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it until many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secrecy of Paraguayan households, has a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira passed on to Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply involved in the Criadazgo practice rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest rallies and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos was widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," says Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case occurs before judgment, the case of Carolina Marín might be trend-setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo occurs in court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she purified the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration. it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is busy with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years in rebuilding the lives of those affected by the "Triple-Catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a state prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, as the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">To this end, Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes whereas Fukushima accounts for 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one still endeavours to relocate evacuated accommodation in the final replacement houses six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by accommodation establishments (to the most part, casetsu juutaku).</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe almost 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in accommodation establishments.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, more and more 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people were evacuated to final homes after disaster.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land, whereby only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima can be re-used again.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farmland destroyed by Fukushima lie in the "nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it seems more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how their reception changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed think that there has still not been enough of disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to evacuate the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused on the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture also witnessed the worst, disastrous, atomic accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been converted into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas most of the evacuated people are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across people from other countries speaking a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that it connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over speech and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherita explains how the love of music overcame the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of Álvaro Reynoso's law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular church Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as the el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no matter that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After planting the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its plants until the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute to the factories daily.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran veteran who arrives at 4: 00 every day, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are back into operation after a long inactive period because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, published according to the 2016 report "Land economic perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will go into history with certainty," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they constituted a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing date, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of official written documents, which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addresssat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he asserts.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, awaits the retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>

<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important worksheet producer has been wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the workplaces and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut speech of October 21, 2002, the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to dismount it, they also stopped to asphalve the road, this disadvantaged also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to seek other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became parts of spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without the prospects for the future, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory was created in the area, whose production does not even serve to supply the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>
<seg id="682">Forty-nine people gave the old soldier a rent of two thousand peso per month to spend the years in retirement in Mañalich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin colour, small, with few teeth and clear voice, is not a supporting person, yet he does not forgive the lies that you told him.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have been torturing him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene goes to retirement for 65 years, not because it lacks power, but because it is bitter.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do this by hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop managers have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in north-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Gruppe The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop thus increases the young participants in talks like" "" "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" "" "or whatever comes to mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of Tears, a road section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unenlightened.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always control the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Gruppe, who gave them a stopper in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "this is the day when you will take our cry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how she lives a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward as well to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have intended for the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("Plastic models of dishes") are exhibited by every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend now turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food processing is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the compass.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon cheating?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and ribbons made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can look at further bizarre plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # of the...</seg>

<seg id="750">Reporting on drug dealers such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were fighting between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime is not only concerned with our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of Aprender a vivir con el Narco explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known disease and sensationalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I've come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculpt those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified by the fact that they were" "" "watered down" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not touched and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the Capital District: how a family was sacked with threats." it describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month for month until they destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report in the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation signed by Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and makes "Chichi" for the babies living with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor was 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8,5 morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by the Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this contribution and the pages to which he links contains pictures on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to unequipping a rumor or to expose falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release it has been used irreversibly to convert tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong combination of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Authorities' representatives described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a movie nearby which was full of people watching the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charted bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture titled" "" "This is Nigeria." "" "from Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charted bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What has not happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a local people to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misadmissions; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Even a step further, personal comments like this example falsely precipitate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations described those who could flee blows, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared as the following, which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which in 2012 falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Thein said, monks and politicians participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the picture from the DR Congo to view this information.</seg>

<seg id="859">The global reach of false information</seg>

<seg id="905">This correction, which appeared exclusively in English, also includes references to fake images of rumors that Hate Speech operate and are used by extremist groups to show that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often spread by Burmese nationalists).</seg>

<seg id="907">This post, which directed itself to the members of the Orthodox Church, clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Thein had admitted his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who had been killed by Boko Haram published by Análisis Digital, now deleted from the Catholic Church, has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the killings, but it claims that it constitutes a "similar" jihadist attack. "</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture came into circulation later in the context of the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo picks up with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message allegedly written by a "father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this one here in Vietnamese and declared it unsubscribe.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretinese missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos dissociated himself.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other accounts, generators and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey) TinEye also points out, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the crawler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture ultimately wears a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions on silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that rejecting images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers, and empower them to feel empathy (for example, this study, which investigates how violent media work on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">"" "technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" "" "fake news." "" "they will need to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which a picture may suggest something, which can actually be replaced by the context or in a completely abusive way." ""</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. invaluable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well-known today (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example words from the language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Painting you for your parents in recognition of how you have tried to care for yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other ways of thinking and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="972">After an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and almost 100 people were missing because of the floods and mud winds.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people have been evacuated to 304 safe places of stay.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls slowed down on Saturday (27 May) and the water levels in some areas went slowly.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>

<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are ready to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>

<seg id="987">Please call the number 0777449729 or 0777843841, if you need assistance in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi call app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Katastophenentrum is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the Roanu tropical storm, PickMe introduced a "flood aid" button which allowed users to call a vehicle for collection of assistance and donations. they were then forwarded to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also introduced a "SOS" key that resulted in more than a thousand enquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floodwater and landslides.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the invaluable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not based on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been organising events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is associated to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to listening, to appreciate, to touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers will first present their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience is attuned to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also seizes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyaminara tells the cable of the rabbit and the baboons in Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his cable, John Nyaminara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS to organise their own story narrative tours.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to $72 million, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017; the march started at the Andecanese Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to the Plaza de Colón in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens's Front for the Neural Testing of Debt) and the ecumenical church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of refixing the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Duling de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of book Sprints, produced copies from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Postal Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what is the real cost associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process from time-to-time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel from Adra prison, a non-military institution, was transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the Military Court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad administration and they were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, its place of stay and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently crossing the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes were more provisionary than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet completed this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 to her husband when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, a minimum of 17,723 Syrians have died in prison by 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mosambique reacted with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not call the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrida de Pública, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to restore the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate disciplinary proceedings against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently was silent however and did not make reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "contradictory" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to become reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza likes to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I cannot believe that one was rewarded in such a way that the state had already so massively offended.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morals and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become weary of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered for the Mosambians as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - incidentally - prophetic speaker.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East India origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "Kalar" "", "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely rejection connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basically different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spalterbse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooniutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">But he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question face (la) on Burmesan - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write to faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should do instead is to carefully analyse the post and control it by checking the words of the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spacers).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dirty nationalists who disseminate hate language have a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "now it is time to cut off their nationalism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who broadcast hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his views on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also appears as if they started doing this without local context or technical support and banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great deal of turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebook's automatic censorship has provided plenty of mockery among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain a hate language but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian movie." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where arguments between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the spreading hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of just censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than on code-focused initiatives and learn from them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia site was presented internationally on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using strapping tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 took place after the Internet Act (Nr. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several MirrorPages (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated) have emerged.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available, despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we took all the snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in distributed and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least check all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrorsites when Wikipedia is banned in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as collaborators at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to grapple with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as this first-class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) invoked me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I started off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was and I immediately started crackling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune Nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know it, for he was already standing face to face with tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he straightens immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune Nature and Wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyotia and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with great care avoid speaking the name of their husbands or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of their social pressure, they should respect the husband as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the standard of keeping this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state Odisha by a pseudo-court and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives is also common among men. however, they have far fewer admittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health workers and housewives, entered a unique club and became quickly the main subject of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them only where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paste has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS, and leads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her panel discussion was of women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To pronounce the name of their husbands loudly, is a custom that they all owe and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband so far, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Break of a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she smoked just before herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their saying.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member of the club decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the tin-red dot if he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their life they celebrated their birthdays with cakes in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought of before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never spoken so honestly about some things, for example like our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a sage Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, the morality linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own pair of ctas (upper hemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion decision, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done only little steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with Albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in the South African country carried out a mission in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight against these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks, the Mosambian police warned about the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably off-believing rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blogger poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the major social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MIGCHTE GERMAN EIN Mozambique, THE SICH ashamed A country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks, and would not violate their lives or even take their lives to earn their bread, a land in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for unbelievers or "black magic" will be hunted.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some could not miss the opportunity for macabre humor.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter beneficiary, tweetete that both the chief of the district Morrumbala, Pedro Sapange, as well as the police spokesman Zambézias, Inácio Dina, are both bald:</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: netizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel laureates and dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China referred to Lius case as "an internal affair," and a spokesman told that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway in Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government shared that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, since exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling upon China to release Liu and his wife from house arrest without delay and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as stated in an Declaration on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the message prompts the Chinese authorities to not only release Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the U.S. embassy summons a furious response from China, with the expression of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to intervene and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government forward to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the news agency Reuters that China had great doubts as to whether the vortex could overshadow Liu's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak with anyone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to permit enforcement of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's State Department requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those seeking peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese lawgiver Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to permit the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very worried about Liu on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in the face of it, it seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the main point of the topic, the good old body appears again from the authoritarian rulers to be Democrats, leaving the twisted logic, because it is better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system, really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred related questions with non-answers of a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point, provided he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">While Anon published his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the whole message of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the headline.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of those cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore" "" "be not a country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as a leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said.</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is correctly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr Shanmugam" "" "made a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not defend their city?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our prime minister pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with the rumours about certain parts of the world to be revealed and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The most recent part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutors by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification then follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly with anger when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada really was a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that parodes the junta, which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour band describes a young man who tells the prescriptions of his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially regarding the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persisted over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which grants absolute decision making on important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious program for the" "" "setting change" "" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are seen as critics by the junta." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army that monitors and monitors online content and prosecuted persons accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand is committed to" "" "Lese Majeste" "" "(Majestic Dispensation)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup d "état of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car before bringing them to an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the song showed members of the band, who imitated the Salut from "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by putsch opponents during the 2014 protests.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-colored earrings in Teddy Bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez recounts, the people come in full busses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on their way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then to move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "says Felix Micheletti, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak at Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he tells." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula are from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers can consult their telephones calmly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter's daughter with African hair lichen she has made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she puts her in front of me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, mobile users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a conservation service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those living in distant, troubled ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "images from mainland China" based on Twitter, which censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen randomly checked the residents, whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use appliances intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can highlight the password requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and party related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police station.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slows down to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belongs to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now Hdaib has been a passionate activist who poses the conservative majority and questioned her well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman's relevance, but also in cities that extend from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't admit it openly, he has a special envy against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I'm a man," "" "while he has dissolved in water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a dazzling hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slugs of lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou 'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputy and former spokesman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila praised the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to advocate for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply silly rhetoric, but in fact reflect an ever more obvious emerging reality in Jordan that appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional sex men by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently dashed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years Jordan has increased the number of 'honourable murders' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its zenith in 2016; however, it is still surprising that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime from the year 1954 women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that are long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics was intimidated by politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are in essence politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse repeats quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in his words," "" "what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program, Roya, to memorize that his comments were torn, distorted and censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only an edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who later should work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the Hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service held several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they had critical comments in social media to the problems related to the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is, according to the opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied a performance for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's how it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will embrace a genuine and fundamental openness through music, art and literature - and not by bombs, scattered unitions and artificially-induced democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it reaches far, Hdaib will continue to tow and therefore resists resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the ballads, drums and dancing were delivered over more than a thousand years ago and come from a time when armies marched from western Japan to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two trolleys are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely external appearance and body care were as important as in this history, as they help keep the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are common.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru experienced - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the fancy hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more regular citizens into the skilled hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against barber tools and to receive training in hairdressers instead of bad advice.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year started in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve published." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we just write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">The two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation did not go beyond their heads and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la praación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace agreement with the guerrilla occupation FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), forming the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered to be as significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombian people there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would close together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who then should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need much more need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed most urgent attention this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they had done before to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies between them," said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cameras" (a sort of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty Sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I spoke to him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer to a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life has anyone written such a beautiful thing, so I answer it." "" "suddenly my tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"" "" "" "until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already at war and the FARC acted already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State had looked upon the whole Colombian people.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no right to vote, and to recognize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and have done so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Columbians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequalities, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are ready to resort to weapons, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC are now on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which patient were you laid - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there's still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They said absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by going through the streets above; others wanted me to appear in Grosny on the official television and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad things, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have basket size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which has broken not only your family, but the whole of the Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">To my mother it became too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked out the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering without proof, without it all.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived at and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe you're in security just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it's the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"" "" "" "however, we don't talk about gender equation, this is a taboo subject." ""</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasus elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to see how the person looks, to which she is reminded of her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who are dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For that, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">I mean, they probably load the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person affected and at the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there is not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are captured there, so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radiate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was there even when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known all over Grosny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the grave!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, back then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally intended to bring us to the "civilisation," but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubjeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of security of Sharia never hurt me with just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means:" "" "mock not about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut their eyes in front of you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow went to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic worsened steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself, when I applauded the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you sweat in front of the mouth that there are no gays in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestaners have who, the cabards, have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transidentity to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed for his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, such Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community resides in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses Ahwazi-Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of sponges to divert water from the Arab territories to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among Arab Ahawzi youngsters now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian director of cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists are beating alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be women.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of the same education women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, black women women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused with racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to" "" "uplift their voices and" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "to achieve equality (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background tend to be referred to school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all men, have the same rights any skin color; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take account of injustice in her mind, which refer both to the gender and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women forever and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanised and marginalized creature in a historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups which, moreover, absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of the Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming, says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and where the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can raise black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 advertisements went to the District Attorney Office for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>

<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>

<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had so long enjoyed Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media, but it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists itself helps build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">AGA: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being makers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">AGA: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">AGA: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, health (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">AGA: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a researcher in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only be made available against payment (the so-called Paywall) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of salad he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or chilled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carrot varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition Morton is still breeding a salad, but he now needs longer since his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is like a boulder in a river that I have to blunt." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand trial, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful, however, and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he has also joined a movement that gets bigger in the US and around the world: open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breeding)." ""</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative called Ossi, US-breeders can commit themselves to the fact that other seeds bred by them can be freely used.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" growers only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor der University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new crops, both in food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed, as it is offered in August and September 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seed free. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, an executive director of Ossi, has found herself in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all flashcards are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders to be usable at all or even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suggest that mass grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even larger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such, by which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point to the fact that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predictable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker's Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts the notion that intellectual property advocates other breeders as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not hinder innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, there is certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton, however, is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">On the whole, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make it self-sufficient and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed mass-wise herbicides, cultivates in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly gentrified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patenting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"" "Morton also believes that breeders are more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "" "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalogue, because I know my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years, "he says." with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, with which you think it's pretty easy. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a "open source" seed programme. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre cooperates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi commitment cannot simply be one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still locked up content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th of August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information - despite this attack and the ridiculing of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who actually defend the law, have never been as important as it is now. ANHRI affirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to yield. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of wave of website closures fell victim. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is also home to the Ziadas blog, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in prison after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blockade by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of deldelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, a attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have an influence, even though only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers by changing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">She reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs has been offering began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention of continuing to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by means of which it can proceed in court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in all Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-olds shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air port to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the midst of the economic crisis and a tense financial situation, the 2017 wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "in this way, the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, announced that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a martial art in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues to call the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold accountability in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company in South America, is an extra member of the company, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policies also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police custody and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this led to a decrease of violent deaths. for several years, however, UPP has become increasingly under fire after several reports about chicans and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">"" "for this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes entering into the territory of a" "" "enemy" "", "in which a civilian is a rough point in the landscape and becomes an object for" "" "collateral damage" "" "and" "" "lost spheres" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">War sooner or later, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now that the police clapped the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed on the basis of the United Nations investigations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas controlled by rebels have been under siege outside Damascus, which meant that local residents are dependent on locally produced food or food smuggled through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become inaccessible to large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "food-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are very rarely part of Syrian cuisine. however, their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and relied on his relief that it is gaining more and more prominence. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of the planting of mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article's Constitution, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, September 04, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they started" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "" "before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger bathtub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi anywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many cities of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower.</seg>

<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in 2017 alone in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of easily inflammable wood, as in a vicious circle, continue to spread to the fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the civil defence website of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative, which provided the people with information: they used their own civilian data protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigade and was so instrumental in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stick to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million accesses.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf returned to Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">A couple of years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars who were heavier than himself in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high welcome quotas. however, it is also true that the conditions governing asylum seekers in the country are disastrous." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers under a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre, if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Having made various works in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf placed all his savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years, some of the companies operated by Afghans have been created, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the Kabulogna Pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets extend far beyond the Italian gastronomic trade and retail outlets and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>

<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that provides users with social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use social networks, within six months of their successful legal decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Whoever missed this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the unending of a criminal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been promoted by 60 members of parliament, is currently available to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May another Member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which tougher sanctions would be introduced for the insult to the President or a senior civil servant." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the president and state institutions is already punishable. however, under the law of law, such an act would however be punished with prison and fines, so legal experts from Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has already been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As more than 700 protest participants who were arrested at the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in jail for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because the prison administration failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatened the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, headlight of among others weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>

<seg id="2949">The document published on the Nawaat website on 21 April sheds light on how the presidential plans look for supporting the template.</seg>
