this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation , in which the CIA gave Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they can &apos;t protect the identity of the courageous ones that they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although it was necessary for years that it would be essential to its case , the demands of the government were dropped to fa@@ ther@@ less .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failing to fail and bring can@@ opy to the testimony , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly worried his telephone cards ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit information , and even travel notes with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ky source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers at his accession . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower becoming a journalist .
so we put the press work at stake , which is to be protected by the first constitutional addition , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as government technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software , which still didn &apos;t exist when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than regular mail or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet celeb@@ r@@ ity received by us Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site just like the here of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot store any more information secretly , and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology designers like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to kill offen@@ ders . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who warns the alarm for the poll@@ uted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes , but to protect our entire constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the largest data sheet of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that emp@@ ires and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has post@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are nervous about the next release , and the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems weeping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and covering for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fas@@ cists .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I find it interesting also that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but due to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some U.S. states one needs less information , need less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that everyone , up to a lawyer , made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult .
this may sound very ru@@ th@@ less as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that a lot has begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen violations of transparency , as concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is la@@ gging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit to stop this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a ticket sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to get kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how do you please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I stepped out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at the toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate goes out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door went into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former fellow @-@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ch@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet they can invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we warned that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we , as children , have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you remember the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design be something like this ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we were striving for .
it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
put your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this silent touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can read not only your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail to this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told you from wh@@ ence he came from , how could his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you would have 150 evaluations , all of which say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to abandon negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it gets exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation makes common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that confidence depends on how much you price from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to abandon these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need not met beforehand .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were un@@ authorised parties celebrated or apartments rav@@ aged .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the disappointment heard in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can occur .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgement :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know it right at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a commercial trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now just nam@@ ing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not do justice to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it &apos;s easy to compare with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you would like to visit , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of a pub that you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
today apartments are designed according to privacy principles .
what if we would create apartments for reason to share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking lots belonging to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
we had a lot of hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a g@@ ull @-@ gym @-@ fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , facing the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively embra@@ ced the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , asked , questioned , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ endorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard , &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the acts of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as we were driving in silence -- as deep as I was driving in my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not be em@@ ailed to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were considered Muslims to be free and beating .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also mad .
it is not easy to have to explain themselves continually .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslim .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
there is only the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there might be a few parking places free , but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to regard people of other fai@@ ths more tolerant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
as a first person , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
when we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we have to stop people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
when Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sacred Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought her into silence and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque was preventing them from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually more neurological studies -- shows : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more likely to accept an author@@ itarian governance system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if people submit messages in which negative reports have been reported about Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundations of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assignment of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become an experienced young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the start .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or we stayed safely at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , put forth my shoes , and went to the house of prayer , and what I saw left me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you so much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thinking woman with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be mistaken . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look to Muslims all over the world , and I did the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is just about becoming a billi@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
before air @-@ parcel delivery enters into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience .
through inter@@ connecting , air@@ planes achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces .
you can also build self @-@ deduc@@ tible structures .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are in space .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a subsidiary of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ern , it can float , and thus has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts that coinci@@ de to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flying machines , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is simple mechan@@ ically , there is a lot happening in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere .
but it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter . in order to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability to throw it right if all look at me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in indul@@ gence , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned right when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
if aircraft are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops out , the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly further , even if restricted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will demonstrate this by making half of it air@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression .
we took common micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway , the particularly safe machine is going to be a flying lamp@@ shade .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for types like us , wages are in development and act of creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed around each other in a very far away galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , they lit bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us classi@@ fy the events in the first time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a few days of life on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise about through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized her as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o was considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes stro@@ ked through the earth .
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
all that I worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes for 23 years and her by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave is a cr@@ us@@ cation in the structure of space and time .
when transferring the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stack@@ ed into the other .
lec@@ turers often lead to a truly Alpine dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and du@@ st@@ ow . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ amped by us when the waves hit . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o workers to be crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points .
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
for example , the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is speaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make simple images of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
so if we trans@@ mu@@ te wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the space talking .
the gravity to listen can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like this : the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of motion vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14th , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s talk about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
there is the remaining meaning of lig@@ o .
lig@@ o p@@ aves a new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- practically or fundamentally -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about space from them .
the exciting physical processes happen however at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through that these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own light @-@ light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the din@@ osau@@ r bones for our archaeological work , so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on what is happening in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tasted an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear to stop talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my beak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I swear to always play with them once you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magic effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things look like you &apos;re thinking about life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I am creating television . I produce television .
I make television , in a large scale .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for one episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days at four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : show To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself and not just produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing this yet ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard will take a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just typing on the computer and fanta@@ sizing , and it &apos;s true if I say : I don &apos;t dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
so as if you take a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and sensible . and the best part is the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could forever drive on it .
many people accept when I explain to them the h@@ um that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , I do it .
but the sums -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . the sums !
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a hum@@ ming then you can &apos;t look different to size .
the feeling of not being different than to strive for size no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not a failure , and I only know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I am , the more episodes the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there , the more I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sum@@ mons ?
and then the tot@@ als stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ laid , burned out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da &apos;s country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regret , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleeps not , does not give up with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Pre @-@ Show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the tot@@ als I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hur@@ l you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you work , you are working , you love what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives to one the bu@@ zz when you know the sums , and who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; south @-@ states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am titanium and my sw@@ um bet@@ we@@ ens , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xes and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl is letting go in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a sum@@ mons .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium sum , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the sums are not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
real sums depend on love .
hum@@ ming is the current that comes from the lust of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sums are ignored by the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the false words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of all guilt .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as good as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be at home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we walk around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and speaking to me my teen@@ y @-@ daughter all fifteen minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can take 15 minutes to play , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I see and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on a piece , why not allow for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I do not work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of labor are part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful .
it &apos;s me dum@@ b that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn still .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things look like , I raise you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
they certainly have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one is implant@@ ing an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circu@@ it@@ ry of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurological function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that the brain s@@ lows the brain and increases the pressure of the skull at the skull @-@ brain trauma .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw this under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into any cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however , -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them color in order to be able to keep them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ imported them to the point of view of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ en@@ act these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ en@@ act the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we made an injury and re @-@ imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we color in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from one tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured in the motor cor@@ tex the manual motor sector .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , which recovered spontaneously .
it can produce about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we re @-@ imported the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since then we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , so on .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years will it take for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , you have to apply it to a multi @-@ center study .
you must first truly demonstrate that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable fact .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my nasty friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I be@@ g you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are er@@ ecting mis@@ belief , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction , which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the D@@ ebt Mountain , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is too scar@@ ce to invest in it , where it would be productive and income , with which it could be productive and income that humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that , like in an infinite loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , as in an infinite loop , promote the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors , which could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances cause that Ö@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
its extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to saving the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally concluded too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mitig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it denied the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but rather more important and decisive , that they gave them the right to political participation with equal bal@@ dness in questions of the state of state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long .
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , while the economy gradually under@@ mines politics and dis@@ ma@@ yed it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not at a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power , because the power is dependent on politics in the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of predat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably has dec@@ im@@ ated the animals that feed them , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , inequality increases , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look particularly well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin @-@ tops higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , just like it -- already very soon , as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the spheres of economy and politics , and ensure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; in which machines are used in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines are used to put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or to indulge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like ut@@ opia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in brief .
in the area of the company : please introduce yourself to a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital comes from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all comes from capital and from redeemed , and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises , but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but not belong to the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up @-@ to @-@ rise twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 greatest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which it fav@@ ors privileged people , and marx@@ ist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , globally Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we do this , technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by trans@@ mitting this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore am I a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not un@@ winding , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic @-@ free zone .
in a sense , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now to pre@@ tend to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century , smells huge after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to us from compl@@ ac@@ ency and perpet@@ ual den@@ ial that a massive de@@ fle@@ ction line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massive threat to the development of the whole of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to make it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to vote for den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he says he did not make a mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of the len@@ ders imposed on this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 which seems to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for so many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows addic@@ ted to where after watching a relay asks your brain : &quot; where are there more from these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean bead , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon does something so that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows by an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and when Amazon releases things for nothing , do you access , right ?
millions of spectators are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this is the answer , and it reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , i.e. the reviews they show the shows the shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is now : what is happening here ?
you have two very competitive , data sealed firms .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work like that , then this is a bit frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we learn more and more about statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that it was able to predict out@@ breaks of influenza , the bad way , through data analysis of Google research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year by year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the cancellation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data continually flows into decisions of life -- at work , by law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years , I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do two things :
first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a branch you put together the items together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but deciding on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many people know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at that moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will contest it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
so maybe the ball gets wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end , it &apos;s not the data , but the risks you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
