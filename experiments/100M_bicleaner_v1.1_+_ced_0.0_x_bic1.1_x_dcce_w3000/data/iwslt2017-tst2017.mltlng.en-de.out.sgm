<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation, in which the CIA gave Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistle-blowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they can't protect the identity of the courageous ones that they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although it was necessary for years that it would be essential to its case, the demands of the government were dropped to fatherless.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to fail and bring canopy to the testimony, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly worried his telephone cards,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit information, and even travel notes with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risky source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers at his accession. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower becoming a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work at stake, which is to be protected by the first constitutional addition, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which still didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than regular mail or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet celebrity received by us Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site just like the here of the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot store any more information secretly, and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it's up to us to ensure that not only technology designers like Edward Snowden have a chance to kill offenders. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who warns the alarm for the polluted water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our entire constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the largest data sheet of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that empires and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has postbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are nervous about the next release, and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and obscure their assets -- something we have been discussing and covering for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fascists.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting also that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some U.S. states one needs less information, need less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone, up to a lawyer, made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very ruthless as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen violations of transparency, as concerns the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit to stop this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a ticket sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to get kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how do you please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I stepped out of bed, embarrassed at the toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate goes out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [Airbed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door went into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-mate, Nate Blechczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We warned that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in consolation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we, as children, have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you remember the things you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be something like this?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Put your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can read not only your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail to this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told you from whence he came from, how could his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evaluations, all of which say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to abandon negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It gets exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation makes common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that confidence depends on how much you price from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great works of art in your apartment! I make a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to abandon these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need not met beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unauthorised parties celebrated or apartments ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment heard in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wondrous can occur.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know it right at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a commercial trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now just naming the" "" "rental industry" "" "does not do justice to the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it's easy to compare with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you would like to visit, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of a pub that you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today apartments are designed according to privacy principles.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments for reason to share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking lots belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone 785,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">We had a lot of hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A gull-gym-fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">As a first person, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>

<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke brought her into silence and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque was preventing them from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>

<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually more neurological studies -- shows: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more likely to accept an authoritarian governance system, conformance and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if people submit messages in which negative reports have been reported about Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundations of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before air-parcel delivery enters into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interconnecting, airplanes achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-deductible structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are in space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a subsidiary of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level. for example," "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the Starrflüglern, it can float, and thus has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moveable parts that coincide to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled flying machines, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is simple mechanically, there is a lot happening in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">But it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter. in order to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it right if all look at me is low, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in indulgence, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are imaginable in models, the rest is learned right when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">If aircraft are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops out, the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly further, even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">"" "" "" "we will demonstrate this by making half of it airworthy." ""</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took common micro-quadcopters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Broadway, the particularly safe machine is going to be a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>

<seg id="469">3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far away galaxy, so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lit brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us classify the events in the first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, there was just a few days of life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech to search for gravitational-waves, which arise about through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized her as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer gravitational-wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo was considerably increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes stroked through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes for 23 years and her by observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a cruscation in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When transferring the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stacked into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers often lead to a truly Alpine dance in courses on the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and dustow."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stamped by us when the waves hit. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after comma followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo workers to be crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is speaking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make simple images of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we transmute wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the space talking.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very fast, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like this: the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- one who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's talk about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in the universe, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the remaining meaning of ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can not see -- practically or fundamentally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about space from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen however at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through that these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is covered by its own light-light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on what is happening in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>

<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tasted an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to stop talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kitten" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kitten, I need milk for my beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on I swear to always play with them once you ask me to do so. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things look like you're thinking about life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I am creating television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days at four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: show To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself and not just produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard will take a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I'm not just typing on the computer and fantasizing, and it's true if I say: I don't dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as if you take a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and sensible. and the best part is the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could forever drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the hum that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, I do it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work and work, build, create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a humming then you can't look different to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than to strive for size no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not a failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I am, the more episodes the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there, the more I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this summons?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, overlaid, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda's country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regret, nothing to delegate, a titanium sleeps not, does not give up with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a Pre-Show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the totals I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Hurl you, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you work, you are working, you love what you do to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives to one the buzz when you know the sums, and who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "south-states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to the outside, late, and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anyone any more" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am titanium and my swum betweens, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says:" "" "mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, I can't do anything except to fit out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, waxes and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl is letting go in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a summons.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the titanium sum, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">Humming is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums are ignored by the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real humming is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the false words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of all guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as good as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work than to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We walk around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naive for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"" "" "" "and speaking to me my teeny-daughter all fifteen minutes, I am the mother of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more does not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes to play, even at a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the hum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the buzzing is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of labor are part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me dumb that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my bonfires burn still.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this humming, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things look like, I raise you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the most famous, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, one is implanting an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuitry of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that the brain slows the brain and increases the pressure of the skull at the skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, -- of these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to keep them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-imported them to the point of view of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autootransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-enact these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-enact the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we made an injury and re-imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we color in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured in the motor cortex the manual motor sector.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can produce about 40% to 50% of its original power from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we re-imported the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since then we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years will it take for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply it to a multi-center study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first truly demonstrate that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable fact.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my nasty friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are erecting misbelief, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are blamed, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of extravagance, I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin Summit Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Debt Mountain, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is too scarce to invest in it, where it would be productive and income, with which it could be productive and income that humanity desperately needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US Dollar, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflate the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that, like in an infinite loop, advocates the pessimism of investors, who, as in an infinite loop, promote the pessimism of the investors, which could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances cause that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to saving the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally concluded too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the Athenian democracy because of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the athenian democracy was and is that it denied the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but rather more important and decisive, that they gave them the right to political participation with equal baldness in questions of the state of state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long.</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies in today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, while the economy gradually undermines politics and dismayed it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power, because the power is dependent on politics in the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators that sustainably has decimated the animals that feed them, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it is harming itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, inequality increases, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look particularly well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolishing the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin-tops higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just like it -- already very soon, as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to reunite the economy and reunite the spheres of economy and politics, and ensure that we are democratizing the re-unified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy that lets the film "Matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," in which machines are used in "Star Trek" in which machines are used to put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" Matrix "similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in brief.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce yourself to a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital comes from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all comes from capital and from redeemed, and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the enterprises, but who do not work therein, and employees who work there, but not belong to the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no up-to-rise twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 greatest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and any government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberating, in which it favors privileged people, and marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we do this, technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transmitting this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise as Hayek, therefore am I a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not unwinding, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I may say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now to pretend to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells huge after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say good-bye to us from complacency and perpetual denial that a massive deflection line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massive threat to the development of the whole of the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "it is right to make it right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to vote for denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but if the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he says he did not make a mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were running through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="1027">"" "" "" "despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European." ""</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for so many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "films, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows addicted to where after watching a relay asks your brain: "where are there more from these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine" "" "toddlers and Tiaras." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean bead, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it's the first time Amazon does something so that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows by an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon releases things for nothing, do you access, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this is the answer, and it reads:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix spectators, i.e. the reviews they show the shows the shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is now: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data sealed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work like that, then this is a bit frightening, because we live in a time when we learn more and more about statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that it was able to predict outbreaks of influenza, the bad way, through data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year by year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the cancellation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data continually flows into decisions of life -- at work, by law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years, I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a branch you put together the items together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but deciding on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "We tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many people know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "highly likely" "" "-- right here at that moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will contest it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a bit more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball gets wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it's not the data, but the risks you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
