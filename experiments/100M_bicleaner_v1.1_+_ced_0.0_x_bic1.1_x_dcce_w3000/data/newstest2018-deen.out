Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , which is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former land of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories for days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows , who had to get upset , because the car @-@ nav@@ i took a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavarian At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very enligh@@ tening .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called original position sheets , have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities .
these were developed according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first survey of Bavaria emerged .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave orders for a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide County of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove forward the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ posi@@ blatt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found just like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is the send@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was built 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ sized map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ ks from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots still show no more farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterized north of send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 o &apos;clock of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or on the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the venti@@ l@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße there were once people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was in charge of setting up the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the ank@@ le of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from applying violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution .
there was room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity did not suff@@ ice any more - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar , 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in architectural reference to the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during WW@@ II during bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the city centre .
a big remained to this day - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days are the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes Travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for African @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a series of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents in recent times occur throughout the state and can be noted here , &quot; says the Group .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , prompted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group quoted incidents such as rac@@ ist violations of black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which shows that black drivers in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring the money or the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime program , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th position of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fence project is elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties in the right @-@ grab@@ bing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales can be found on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the President of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area cares for a lot of work , much needs to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the re@@ forest@@ ation of the areas could be pulled out quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers are often critic@@ ised for their support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence support .
the open conservation area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 Euro the half was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus , the farmers had 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of f@@ ences .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveying backdrop marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the fenced area must not be ski@@ pper@@ y ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ forest@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the fishing season 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build some 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the open @-@ plan area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully orchest@@ rated down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ im@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he res@@ or@@ ted to its significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , / your oppressed masses , longing to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; waste was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a high political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classical ima@@ gery .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great Schrei@@ der R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty inv@@ ades anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative who brings the American flame into the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh stum@@ bled upon something .
the significance of the statue is quite a matter of point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not to light the way , but the hate that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black praise Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship loader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special has been developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally included were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les at its fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ stre@@ cken@@ rotor Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads along this road and has set five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that you should watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are at the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics about Facebook : do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore accused him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his ha@@ un@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum which is designated as official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post was talking to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not full of hate , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was cour@@ te@@ ous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like this idea even if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest demonstr@@ ators or to silence them .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County made the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck their leaders .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which last year led in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new location and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player home to South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the home ground for action .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer through passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the director of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
traffic , which hin@@ ders the construction work again and again , is a major problem for the construction work of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off bags is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are allowed to travel through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ arot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ ment in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called not@@ a - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ ted tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence against the Dutch rule turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers from it .
in 2003 , the Province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea the eastern part of the island .
En@@ arot@@ ene is as secluded as it is . the journey involves a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated roofs that have been transformed into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones through rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is the poor@@ est province in Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berger , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port destroyed gold and copper worth 3.1 billion dollars .
in addition , Papua also has wood resources worth an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua , which ensure Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid close to $ 20 million in local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden gi@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military .
massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ lands in the 1970 &quot; s were made to commit genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Will Loc@@ ate Every@@ thing &quot; in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric set@@ backs are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous who moved to the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tasted the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ arot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se in their tone and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and smote the group with their rif@@ les , told victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ an Y@@ eim@@ o , was hit so severely that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building was ign@@ ited by the nearby government commission and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial gu@@ y@@ ways and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ song im@@ iti@@ sing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to hur@@ l stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official TI@@ ME document which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ arot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only has a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings was first filtered on the following day to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for resol@@ ving historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to took a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ ors of bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police shot villa@@ gers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office office .
the police said the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) ki@@ cked off the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered here quickly so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a haven for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free State Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by shooting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ arot@@ ene is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato each .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the indigenous people of Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier immigrants .
they rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .
beyond that , restrictions of reporting on international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although rare permission was given for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the vice @-@ president of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s electoral campaign , the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less eastern provinces of Papua and Western China : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ fic states called T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread hur@@ ts &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , indigenous people broke their silence and urged him . &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but want to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states say that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ov@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants Jok@@ ov@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other countries , consider their voice to Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of an victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never get justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire was held on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is usually called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and shou@@ ting of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00 p.m. GMT ) extingu@@ ished fire and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 concluded that most of the damage was caused by fair@@ ing , outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has enjoyed a great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single was only supported by the two @-@ thirds majority for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles .
these often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was just scar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member@@ nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
it was not until the vote that after many in@@ consisten@@ cies the proposal had already come to bring the final to a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host &apos;s right in the first round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media deadlines before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 passengers bring forbidden objects into the plane , find out a survey
a survey among air passengers showed that over 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled by the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while acci@@ dentally carrying forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they were late to discover that they were mistakenly sent with guns , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - operated by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common objects that were deliberately transferred to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported to have borne wit@@ t@@ ingly borne objects with blades through security control , while 2.@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it questioned travelers across the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware had brought about airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most frequent .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure about which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the huge number of pre @-@ orders for its new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far failed that a part of the customers have withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation again .
in addition to the ever @-@ tri@@ ump@@ y figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k will give the first time a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous number in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had adverti@@ sed the new car with more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car .
now Mus@@ k cle@@ ars : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that they are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are present , in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be - 500@@ ,000 - one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are required per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines with maximum capacity without any major interrup@@ tions in practice .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there is too much delays , the un@@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the postpon@@ ement of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , res@@ igned its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit that was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable enemy of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations to which chemical industry and industry are resist@@ ing fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement stated that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York general prosec@@ utor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributing to thousands of premature deaths .
public health officials and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ itts &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos;s Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tumours their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg Docum@@ entation : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
the wor@@ ding of the document on Tum@@ linger Berg in addition to the former parish church was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ate law belonged and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the settlement nucleus of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval in@@ church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
this was associated with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two sh@@ rou@@ ded on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to crash in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the bell tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and half over@@ threw .
to prevent an evil , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower @-@ tower existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , 16th July , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old grav@@ ey@@ ard .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .

association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his authorisation for the construction of planned wind turbines in Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the town border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these zones are meant to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had agreed a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days before , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve because of a form failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself on the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 meter high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , where the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ ac@@ re area .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households should be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were injured easily .
the state road remained closed for hours .
following the police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car was driving the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; city and traders plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ berg and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce the residents to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
as the chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers what offers the city &apos;s own city apart from the usual supermarket goods .
accordingly , a market with regional vendors is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearer region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the commercial association and the city walk into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; for well @-@ being and sales on Sunday , talks with all the traders and hosts in order to actively participate .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
furthermore , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was , with a network to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which had partly spread , King had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will participate in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence himself with his purchasing behaviour .

Tru@@ mp put pressure after secured tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp requested a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president compla@@ ined because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA and to make Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ug@@ ged to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming torn the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged out of the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience beat very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been lied to by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post @-@ war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights activists .
for him , the post @-@ ordination serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician puts a du@@ vet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the free foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI the black Far@@ mp@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they were then removed from the prison and approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual post of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep racism , of which many want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that it &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the Rest Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ enes Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of the Chef C@@ lan@@ member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the high priest cries out and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , wa@@ ving of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ti@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time --- he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene once again begins .
this time Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends ab@@ violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
a woman dressed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the corp@@ se of the actors and takes Bil@@ lie Holidays a sad song about &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your voice is broken by every second word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ ped sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is split almost evenly between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s body .
children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms weeping , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .

Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski was struggling to find words which felt the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I really do with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today this is called Police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds the courtyard at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ ordination is inspiring in a way , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ vil &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .

the three Rh@@ en@@ ish daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
they lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , rent a corp@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ ers .

there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to go to a stand@@ alone pipe concert , there were five years later a great jubil@@ ee in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced over this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with pe@@ at , but it was also an understanding of his view .
I draw a positive summary .
Max is working as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
amount : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt at the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school already in the open all day .
what are your experiences with it ?
lot : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ day volunteer .
how does that happen ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , you can see how it is , in the focus , perhaps also , really .
and was it like that ?
lot : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunte@@ ering service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works .
other than in civil engineering studies ?
amount : well , it &apos;s not about spending extras here .
again and again other people have their own head , each of which has a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
a lot : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of friendliness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is .
Pear@@ son cuts more than 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut more than 3,000 jobs and cut her interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program is started to overcome the pressure that the company faces .
the job breakdown , announced by the Director General John Fall@@ on primarily for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May Pear@@ son announced in May a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , following an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed during suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the capital of Afghanistan , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , said officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured , a declaration of NATO divided .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the case of the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violent act that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable condition and are treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the U.S. troops re@@ pressed the Taliban in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp ab@@ uses to increase the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in the last few weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it will show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and from responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to re@@ press a broad range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that according to Tru@@ mp must boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature reserves who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ der@@ at wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two votes , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ dos decides to set up a common room in the future home for the elderly .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing grounds is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , it will continue until the area belonging to the church has so far been in municipal ownership , but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor .
for this there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ ver@@ ed to see such a common room not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the righteous living , but openly into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposed proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to throw bil@@ lets between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is similar to the surrounding construction - as well as a pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the board .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one does not move so well , but now you lean at the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any existing or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface you don &apos;t give a subsi@@ dy , but get a real equivalent , in case of doubt , the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s proposal to cut the resolution accordingly finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we touch the resolution , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision by car : Rad@@ ler is s@@ lung on the street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police told , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the road to Hil@@ den on the bicycle path from the road to Hil@@ den .
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove onto the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the road traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must for@@ ego David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba has to let the game play against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven pros are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
personnel worries at the German soccer record champion Bayern München are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in Du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
in addition , the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old however believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 people , distributed by the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin from star to star hike
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Verein Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star @-@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well accessible installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ Path train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was stronger than another , although it would be far more distant .
con@@ veys also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see .
the association operates since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet route leads with its stel@@ es up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commune tracks ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , measuring 70 centimet@@ ers away .
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is good four kilometers .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization super @-@ fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former heav@@ y@@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asc@@ ended for Bron@@ x to 140 pounds , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move on weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ap@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ oned Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side is very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus is to show punch strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ter
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 a.m. shortly before the market broad@@ caster &apos;s market width .
the car hur@@ ried to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it passed over and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was closed in the direction of the North for about an hour , afterwards traffic on the left lane could be passed by at the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
and@@ re Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 to the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , since not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triple chain is to be further optimised .
and the For@@ tun@@ en doesn &apos;t want to catch one goal after a kick @-@ off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the triple chain , even after the experience in preparation .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ body , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just got to the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ izing and not doing so many play mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after an accident of a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand at four points on Sunday and focus on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; the start into the season I judged only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ body , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted early due to a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ body and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a career favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday are going to meet at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we can sweep them away just because we have the right to get under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ body , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as boss coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hitting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ y doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age assessment tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Medical Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started carrying out tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the app@@ rais@@ al of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person investigated is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of men to see if they went earlier or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it sure , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in Plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part of the bridge was installed at the bridge at the eastern edge of the town of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going perfectly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the department of road construction and transport at the government pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is a marginal attachment that is also used as an operating route .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path should be gone .
the special thing about it is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special t@@ act feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cru@@ stac@@ eans had to be f@@ ished initially .
for the bridges between the building yard and the back@@ yard in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ge@@ ings amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest with German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ at
it is not so common that parties pull together , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the district of vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance , which on that day shows a peaceful flag , because Af@@ D invites the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; according to the poster .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ale - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the relevant organizers , really rejo@@ ices : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which also Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported about the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel , he took care of such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the front of the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ woman Uwe Junge .
in the audi@@ torium there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the election of the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free playing mix into a fascinating overall masterpiece .
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher convent church with its special acoustics is consciously incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it up to the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart said openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt a bitter deal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin asser@@ ts against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with everyone I &apos;ve posted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never interfer@@ ed or obstruc@@ ted me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them I suffered according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ung@@ rat@@ eful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but I don &apos;t like to justify the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot;
the rally broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp first promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
meanwhile the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening , saying , &quot; The Gover@@ nor Justice Party change is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather than work to make our country a great one . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the final rejection of a party from above to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , solitary message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of athle@@ tics world championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in competitions of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do all possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about Russia accepting the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the task force recommendations that this is not the moment to re@@ inst@@ ate Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships starting on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , announced on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mour@@ ning for soldiers killed in Mali
during a funeral service in the North Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ clari@@ fied crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two revers@@ ed pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen arrived in the West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
after that the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they laid down roses , the relatives stood in arms on the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ anic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of Le@@ yen : the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish king@@ f@@ isher is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , it was said to be in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - neither after death , declared L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he worked for over the past 50 years .
the native of Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always inter@@ tw@@ ined , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation in this country to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed of me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Minister @-@ President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the Parliament &apos;s resolution was on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to this , the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from her parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his Group to record it .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new parliament will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
for Stephan Wei@@ l , however , it is essential that the Land@@ tag quickly decides its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Land@@ tag depri@@ ves the Prime Minister of confidence and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be checked legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all issues in peace if they are legally audi@@ ted properly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;

the Gre@@ ens called for the dep@@ uties to return their country of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that they have returned their land mandate , which they received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the state Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce a pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ choose the country day .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian places her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General , Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil , in her fru@@ stration and fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony plays this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U Leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the head of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of distor@@ ting the result of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force at that time before the SPD , but the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the country day .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the acknowled@@ gement of Germany &apos;s concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just as the manufacturers ensure that the products sold are safe and safe for health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the residue levels of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
however , un@@ contaminated eggs can be sold and eaten .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any direct guilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , they must expect economic damage because of the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there are too little controllers in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is there a lack of personal or conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ utor in cases where crimes can exist are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ arms really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to buy only safe and safe food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
by means of the counter@@ f@@ eit means manufacturers , distributors and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it has to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are spe@@ edi@@ ly and completely clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play Rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G must prove that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer was financed without big losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy rich ruler family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they have to use legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency of the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of the contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the plan of redemption for the next five years will be reported in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor &apos;s sponsorship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come over payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 denied that N@@ ey@@ mar WM Ambassador will be sent and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easily figur@@ ing out .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and boy@@ cot@@ ting .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consistency of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country owns an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because one can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged chocolate panels at 14 grams are distributed to the passengers in front of landing at 14 grams a year .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ der estimate the volume of orders in the &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a g@@ og@@ gi@@ producer , it is a prestigious order .
Swiss Life does not want to reveal how many applicants are interested in the new tender .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty over spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss chocolate tables have been distributing Swiss banknotes on board their flights since 2006 .
before signing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
for long @-@ haul flights the customers of First Class are spoiled with le@@ aks by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in business class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both in Business and Economy Class on the short circuit .

no@@ stal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90@@ s Gr@@ unge era , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ or ( it contained an original story for speaking ose vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking up at the core of the g@@ ags - actors of middle @-@ aged adults play hor@@ ny children , who grow up - nevertheless , they manage the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering principle , including a reef on the stal@@ ker films of the 90@@ s such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that be@@ ck@@ les the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character cle@@ ars through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy malicious plot that is included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ spoken impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I call his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds of another kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a popular TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays as one .
in six long episodes , the comedy is gone , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ acted to a lower length , could better supply its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ ote a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a ban@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz announced on Friday .
15 were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years old and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
the officials also ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in Italy , two people were arrested in the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were German warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 police officers were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , heavy acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in Southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ utor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was an active exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the Grand Master was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nation@@ als referring to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account of the gang .
Weise prof@@ essing large gaps in the foreigners register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e Management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , atten@@ ds large gaps in the country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned the way in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , 10 million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts had not been good so far .
in isolated cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can slow revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of adequate people , EU citizens are also registered , who would not have to travel at all .
however , such false arrangements led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient funds , &quot; that is , in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun to return refugee families with children under 16 @-@ year @-@ olds back to Italy when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is said that the BA@@ MF performs such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the one @-@ row country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I submitted to Italy for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the scope of the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system , un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to children &apos;s welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood donation for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 100 litres of blood with his 100 donations in the meantime , is above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule .
traditionally , the congregation hon@@ ors multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood in the meeting of the Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for foreigners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
corn makers at the same time reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K District Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many as Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter lost ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on budget revenues would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to raise the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the credit costs would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut @-@ economic package released one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the upcoming February , although it is said that now it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with $ 115 billion ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank insi@@ sted that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a rate raise and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening process is even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent in@@ comes in the coming years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a part of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the P@@ act .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that it was expected and will be re @-@ tigh@@ tened in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , since the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sex pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in case of infection risk .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse implies that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come into question for treatment belong gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics we identify suitable candidates who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ancy , Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son welcomed and over@@ due the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the completion of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , declined in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not grab@@ bed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot long apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a storage room and an intermediate floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut up the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so it &apos;s very easy to slide the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and to use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not fall into electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing .
indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate markets Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the Brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold to USD 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - written by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property is valued at $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed negotiations .
the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but throws Paul into managing some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to share their property with her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to face judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept himself very restra@@ ined even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and , following a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a steady course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information put into the hands of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television ranges back decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his associates manage to keep his anger away from him for a few times , their efforts have paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may encourage their views from the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to lead du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from .
this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tru@@ mp receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and raised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police across Europe will send ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are not known in nature , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action followed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many volati@@ le destinations were hiding at holiday destinations , called it from Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of indications after publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand back with some resol@@ ute travellers on war@@ foot who have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn by the church to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy road called Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they have been thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived last night , probably today even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they move as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible have an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof will be Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue was also received by the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rats@@ amt as a collective shelter , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of seriously interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when entering the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations will be carried out .
the floors have been torn out , blankets partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s really a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is resh@@ ap@@ ed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nicely bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior systems are also brought onto the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .

Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special Agent sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , Special Agent Robert Mu@@ eller will have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
in the past few weeks , the committee recorded the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people familiar with the matter .
the paper marked the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened and intensified his investigation .
the broad@@ caster CN@@ N reported that there are already first announcements of the body in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been accused of bl@@ ending the Krem@@ lin in a targeted manner in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focuses on several men who acted as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller examined more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the special agent Tru@@ mp had personally moved to the center and investigate whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible break@@ through@@ s and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the defend@@ ants .
mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge persons under oath .
according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s advis@@ er and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his then election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were at the meeting .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the sub@@ stitution show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he would act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the onset of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp was to be found .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but this work usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that it was not determined against the president .
one has no reason to believe that something has changed , it was said in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this repro@@ ach , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special promot@@ er and its employees .
this triggered speculation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later rec@@ eding President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft bill on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West Antar@@ cti@@ ca , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg has solved itself from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s , just under seven times the size of Berlin .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut für Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest iron gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for human beings does not come from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the break@@ age of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research information .
all in all , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by great glaci@@ ers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
to the north of this ice shelf , the balance of growth and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a few years ago .
a complete shelf is broken down there , writes A@@ WI scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far back as currently .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be dis@@ assembled if a piece is broken down at one key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small degree , writes the British research project to observe the Antar@@ ctic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI @-@ estimates , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest shelf of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ ses , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , there have been a lot of ice mel@@ ts in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula over the last decades .
this long skir@@ t of the Antar@@ ctic extends in the direction of South America .
according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med around three degrees during the last 50 years and counts to the areas in which the temperature is the quick@@ est .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Krei@@ sel started to use 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are apparently very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be recorded for the places to be missed this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at the moment there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces in general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the request of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for personnel extraction and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application scar@@ city .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete actions for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is dominated by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition by public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service due to illness or age @-@ related reasons .
so the highest time for action so that there are not even more places left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Volk@@ mar , head of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he was already worried about a bad surprise already in the Krei@@ sel , when he publicly questioned the recruitment of personnel and bewil@@ dered the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be verified that enable an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U seeks to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the opening of the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are available only if you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO migrants &quot; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself in detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is assumed that the crew will ship din@@ gh@@ y boats , which are delivered to them directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that ships can be used again .
at least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officer who over@@ sees their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable because they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation is the Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan may@@ ors in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always long asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Folk Fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , look@@ out looked at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ gging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two days there were again a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ scrip@@ tions brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neustadt has also been controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga is getting ready for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles , rather than swe@@ ating through the stadium in wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels inclusive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ liga which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; we hope to inspire very new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several clubs on this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified for themselves .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football must be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract one could be far more often present online in these markets than to send the Federal lig@@ aments to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA football simulation will be challenged at competition level .
long ago , as in normal sport , the professionals have established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and by 2022 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has also taken a long time dealing with the question .
for Professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule Köln , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses , which can also be found in the classic sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console , but also train their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to play in online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were lacking .
the scientist highlights the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
that is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the E @-@ Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
many countries are already on the rise .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe a lot is doing .
e @-@ sport was introduced as a subject in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ ack .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first league clubs have meanwhile been obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department according to D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ President R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into no@@ stal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep on keeping everything as it always was for football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter because of the texts Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings by Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes , when condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day when I do not give the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted of murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ ber was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the Bayern Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm there .
something was different to his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kim@@ ber saw right away , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , there was no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er to see , he made the split stick to his arm .
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; explained the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ Captain .
good , the deposit could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could indicate Kim@@ mir as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who was born from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holidays , but he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sugar is distributed to those who want to eat a lot , which you want to keep in your mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so if you were chosen to take the legacy of L@@ ahm , a little extra motivation can only be used well .
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ ck@@ ered as a mini @-@ L@@ ame over the field .
to the right rear , this is his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and Kim@@ ol@@ ly worked in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ heard tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were occupied with himself .

that at least worked very well .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Pfalz Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year when the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; wi@@ sing acc@@ esses the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 should be the construction law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the v@@ est of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ spokesperson Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
of course , nat@@ us sees it as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) is striving for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label with the wine to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2500 euros , if graduates within ten years after the master training become self @-@ employed .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , facts are to be created , at the same time it is out of the country the necessary staff , says Jan Bell auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
so far only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing at regional mobility .
the Chamber demands more orders to be awarded to external offices .
according to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the CD@@ U group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf added more than 20 million euros less than suggested by country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is also the current broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months because of dis@@ agreements .
Audi to change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a back@@ lash
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW CEO said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus embark@@ ed on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described under@@ tak@@ ings as call@@ backs .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions standards .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install exhaust gases from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rej@@ ecting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system in order to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the winning of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if it pul@@ ls again on Saturday again to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ otran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a protective game of wild . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
mur@@ der@@ ous rab@@ bits and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the rab@@ bits of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to light at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
over calendar , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches continue to find its cute figures worldwide .
for six years he has also worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in its drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his characters in the 3D movie , which will come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo says .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he focuses on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ati@@ m .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and due to diseases transmitted by diseases , what scientists and farmers , trying to find solutions , cause great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the past years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a little Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers but also for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long vegetable oils with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either absent or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian city of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the point of strength is this Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval festival .
dealers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ants or a land @-@ based camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days .
the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat to Mexico
the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ c run normally on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest stop from violence , and while the corp@@ ses are ho@@ vering throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to put his office in December 2012 .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ c , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ya building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ya , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are ou@@ tra@@ geous and although the ground is now more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ c in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ c , has broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
in 2003 he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ c and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without hitting the poison poison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ c , she was awarded the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever they were .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ c team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could flu@@ ke like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happens to J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ c met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ c in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size quarters of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers , whom the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ c has made three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who listened to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
only a few months earlier , the readers considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they have never expected : activists on behalf of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after killing Val@@ dez , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country journalists have become lou@@ der in writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they said the truth .
she has since been asked to re @-@ categ@@ ori@@ ze her by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated its objectiv@@ ity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an equal society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were stuck under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media watch@@ dog &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , states that drug trafficking is scar@@ ce him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ c sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began bu@@ zz@@ ing .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt straps and security forces near the resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of cart@@ ell em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ c via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ten nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ c followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the practi@@ c@@ ants asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid their enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
its incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21st 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that was out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy Earth .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re blin@@ king a bit with your eyes , you could almost believe it was sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have discovered that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with an arm@@ or and similar to a changing tank , are probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ agate , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to move better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and bor@@ rowed Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it points to the fact that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through flesh @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pir@@ ate behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21st 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the reserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the sheds on his sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometers @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured at a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the first indications of the police were between 17@@ .00 p.m. between the junction places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks .
there is no information on the exact number of the injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it deals with light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large supply of ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre @-@ long retreat was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire department noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident happened on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
the result was a collision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : company tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up a sen@@ sel@@ ess or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many other long distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to take advantage of this , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears in the test documents .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
if the train companion arrives at the ticket control at room Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel through our train atten@@ dant without ticket control , simply check the DB Navigator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marketing Bureau . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ ances .
for many times you have , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or any document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further concessions on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled by fac@@ ebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be a Brow@@ ns father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took off her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a floral dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women @-@ child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after August 9th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was president of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film during an evening demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites , in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are portrayed , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s experience - to show that in the movement &quot; not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person that sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory , since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit @-@ Galerie
the bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been spl@@ itting the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves any cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the Bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , from which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction works will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - ad@@ mitt@@ edly to the Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping almost weekly in the market hall for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women gladly again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery rises , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project will probably not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what are the shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are plenty of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mainly offered directly from the producer and is priced at the top .
as you can see , shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger firms , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peasant market hall supposed to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the spec@@ tre bit gallery beforehand to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will simply not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I think - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg do not have any place anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and Haar@@ etz , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after making publicly listed diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .
because of the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment , not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette dum@@ b and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use have become an un@@ equal opportunity to exchange several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chel@@ ub would judge , and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama actually only had a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp introduces a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic disper@@ sion , whose basis sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written - a thous@@ and@@ foot@@ er of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological way , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she shows up with a free @-@ talk phone in the hand of the disciplinary kern@@ els of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they keep your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , that rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a nationwide hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as demonstrated by Cook County &apos;s Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ gage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be in court and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal off@@ ence examined by the competent authorities and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to ask himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he strongly ur@@ ges susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , which said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t have anything to cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren about alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave rise to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one tried to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was expelled from the WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the moment
this divided the Group &apos;s groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be preceded by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs can be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ous anti @-@ housing .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ ups race is on the look@@ out to help businesses find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to offer specific groups and demographic groups , to provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases permit whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to deal with the C @-@ Suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tool is used by companies to measure employee commitment .
ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ ances where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the finance site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw a rising interest and activity beginning this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
the client has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent allows companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , gather confidential responses in real time and view the heat charts of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows staff to report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that handles its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously were hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment liti@@ gation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and pol@@ lu@@ te the companies with recurring charges for using their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that has the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ tering secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff according to your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have left too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow people wondering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now passes monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , saving .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not bound to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose your customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tain on one side of the new teams of exercises of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot@@ ics and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Aqu@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has prolonged their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises .
20 years before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the general change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continue to plac@@ ate themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really gets great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been excav@@ ated with foot@@ balls that are clearing a protective grid behind a door post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ din &apos;s players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake messages to third parties and show their results below the original article , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false noti@@ fications and to send them to factor audi@@ tors that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly eradi@@ cate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be started .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ ies .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ are River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , rising British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who was so beaten with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted pot pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust won the full access until 2006 when the last hei@@ rs , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Empire , maps that represent what possessed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uprising that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron who hid Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century depicted his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; favorite family of Scot@@ ney &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lords seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , always doing debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men redeemed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences
he spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ ges@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf hides
with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as Bad Honnef citizens we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , it is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef has its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit figure .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on boarding and transportation in the officers cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is a routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the headquarters of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions .
thus the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the over@@ count .
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup leader Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ex@@ iled Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as wire pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who have been directly involved in the attempted put@@ sch , has been negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had den@@ ounced as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean up the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the major rein@@ car@@ nation of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 7@@ 3@@ 95 civil servants , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the military &apos;s power step by step , not least on appeal to the European Union &apos;s reform agenda .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is targeting an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution abroad after the attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that such a development could not let Nato get cold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ gations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp said , cited by the media .
he envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do so by changing the way US citizens are issued in other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for road @-@ up shuttle
again and again over the past few months , the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les has been fought - now it is to go quite quickly .
even before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the mar@@ oon track on which the tourist railway travels .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les on a long @-@ term basis , construction work on the road should start in this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost for the repair of the track was about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , is currently defini@@ tively voted , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the race car shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a popular railway link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the route is used by many people in order to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also partly very b@@ auf@@ äl@@ lig .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just when you thought that it can &apos;t be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor for Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman progres@@ sively look progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they appeal to , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robots developed by True Comp@@ ani@@ on with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Comp@@ ani@@ on website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , trouble one the most .
on his website , True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy comp@@ lied with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex@@ toy .
their formation and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not keep any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R records their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what transp@@ ires from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bra@@ ided over women to be sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn @-@ out body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to put it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of trusted relatives .
we are all re@@ port@@ edly trying to let our filter bubbles burst .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet living in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
in order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it seems to me in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the pri@@ mor@@ dial possibility that we will no longer rep@@ el his kit@@ ten .
however , there is still a terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp &apos;s re@@ public@@ ans are &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; in the right wing , which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I think of an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in fact occur as a very mild off@@ ence in comparison to Tru@@ mp .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ming music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a stran@@ gely magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ ties can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have judged the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zed , while I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain reloc@@ ated from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first victim of death .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der that hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Criminal Investig@@ ation Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds an odd egg
as the last of the schools of Blum@@ berger , the districts of F@@ ütz@@ en@@ ho@@ fen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the vac@@ ations and secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school discharge , the 29 pupils of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from its chickens .
instead of a chicken nest , a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was crum@@ bling ; the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the recording of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln who carried cylinders to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school chief An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished for every four @-@ gra@@ der that he feels accepted in his new school .
there followed letter of thanks to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps back to school classes and the parents &quot; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber time was over now , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she left her students only very reluct@@ ant after two years because it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ gra@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season .
there was great joy in the children .
eight original wat@@ chers are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camp people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offer software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars at the diesel summit .
they are expected to improve the emission performance of emissions reductions of Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the upgrade has been ordered by the Federal Office of Automotive ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler announced to write to every person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within the framework .
how long should the retro@@ fitting take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers don &apos;t act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , which do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat to a massive drop in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older dies@@ els .
the ACE advises to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and take part in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award @-@ winning award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced that he would wai@@ ve participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to make her view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after the former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a member of the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied but challenging tasks waiting for his followers .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - taking notice of regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach functions as a sub@@ contracting authority for the administrative community , the applicant must assign corresponding degrees .
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the clos@@ eness to the citizens is important to the city and to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good mood between the authority and the citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in ministry , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz are about to be initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will bring about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design was available for a city builder with great scope .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and landscap@@ ing , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town is listed as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monument protection &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye on what is going on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city master builder emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city master has a high level of responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of staff in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years .
also , his successor will remain long , says W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , according to the town of Has@@ lach you should have completed a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction planning and planning law .
the Municipal Building Authority is subject to construction and civil engineering , construction management planning , under@@ mining affairs , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and city nursery , as well as Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection .
bicycle thrown on lines : South ground track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were badly damaged so that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them since the night .
close to the scene there were witnessed by witnesses a sco@@ oter and a bike rider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger and also end@@ anger the railway traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay and the cost of moving the rail , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum is to be paid out , said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South ground track could be managed without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were cancelled Friday afternoon , two of them were talking about the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall , but they had delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recurring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was noted that a kind of tolerance induc@@ ing immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote more toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus if the same system works with people .
the post@@ doc Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been accommodated separately , did not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kind of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers allowed L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the intoler@@ ance @-@ induc@@ ing cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s feed , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can potentially lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the holder role as people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the Blues @-@ Asia @-@ Tour of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four major new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association for that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of them for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the US state of Mich@@ igan and moved into the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such an advertisement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
but how the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democr@@ at Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire @-@ fires from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Bund - was the most important wish of the elec@@ torate .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Mr Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
and one by one .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Green MEP , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , has pl@@ ung@@ ed into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election of the country , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the apo@@ state Lower Saxony Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est must return her mandate immediately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and Ele@@ ction Manager of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD elec@@ torate si@@ ghs when the new b@@ ob@@ scene message reaches the party headquarters on Friday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the transition of the green dep@@ uties to the CD@@ U .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country feder@@ ations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades reas@@ sured in time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then also - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the stag@@ gering , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te s@@ lash@@ ed the party smoothly .
comrades in the weeks after that te@@ dious up again .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was coming from Hamburg .
and with him came the next blow .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ es@@ ef , lost his nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he got pretty much wrong about what to do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony had already been critic@@ ised for a long time .
some survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of this , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks .
comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz did not hide the desire of the former mayor of Hanover to develop his power in Berlin .
they allowed him to grant him a stabil@@ isation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not at fault with the party internal force of the Lower Saxony Green Party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Mr Schulz is not at all .
at times the comrades try to keep their ranks closed .
their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the apo@@ ge@@ ful Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ests puts her own career in the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary faction , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ v@@ est has not been elected to parliament because of her person , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower Saxony deputy continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary faction , compla@@ ins about an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters willing to vote four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career presents a future CD@@ U member the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for the town centre III
anyone who wants to rehabil@@ itate his family in the years can soon get support from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development were informed on Wednesday in sen@@ timent .
at the beginning of the informative event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back on the happ@@ enings so far .
since 1991 , there have been in sensitive san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding sum .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euro would come from the land , the rest of the church sen@@ timent .
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to examine Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role if there is any interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the re@@ struc@@ tions would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of internal cities , improving the living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per property .
finally , the rehabilitation area would eventually be set as a statute .
the grant period for funding has been running from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , the survey would only be carried out in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area for filling out a questionnaire .
in November or December , it is scheduled to take place as soon as possible , so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year .
afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned investigations .
it is a matter of evaluating the urban planning circumstances and to decide when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there will also be a refurb@@ ishment note in the land register for the respective plot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel emphasized that an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled in until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the rehabilitation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about the size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for subsidies .
moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler pointed out that the distribution of subsidies in accordance with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works - who comes first , grin@@ ds first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot make a grant for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been shown to make a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to come in house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military provided to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire fighter car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military bure@@ au demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his super@@ visor , the Deputy Military Commander for Aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
the records provided by the TI@@ ME were not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal authorities to use state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he advoc@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation when the presidential plane was station@@ ed in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of announcements describing the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end US President at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event mat@@ tered during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers did not over@@ take the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting up the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget names for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund kit for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think most Americans are proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp was talking to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ esting with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
top runners of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga are competing at the S@@ V &apos;s Tab@@ ellen@@ Third World Championship .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss ki@@ cks off tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ellen@@ Third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the still flaw@@ less balance of five games , the leader of the Second Tennis League won the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team playing in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
at the moment the Challen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man is not part of the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) will be at his first use this season .
the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was at the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
he should also be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on the last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z again could move back to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , someone from the Train@@ er@@ ab to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay re@@ fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he placed his signature on Wednesday night under the law of tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Congress adopted a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US advance .
after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that will help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors from the local O@@ MV , who together with other European companies have contributed to the construction of the Russian East Coast South Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at what the group could mitig@@ ate and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the Hit@@ row by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over for a long time .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the newest Bo@@ ys of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A paid attention to the most successful organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise &quot; operate only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( D@@ ami@@ an Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with solid contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day care centers .
on the 1st of September Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in O@@ reg@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food .
the city runs 46 day@@ care centers in Kre@@ feld , where the children get a warm meal at lunch time .
in the last year of the year , 2,@@ 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are at lunch in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care , when children remain until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants will have kitchen service from September 1 : they heat up the delivered foods , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , portions the meal individually , give food out , rin@@ se , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decide on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be completed by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong in the field of education for some 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , the reign@@ ing head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ elled into the provinces in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will pass the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters are registered .

men try to eradi@@ cate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to information from the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but went on with her friends .
then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which however failed .
without a prey the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a union wants to wi@@ den the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow by managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits besides other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s willingness to say &quot; concerns that financing for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce is concentrated strongly on the local community and the metrop@@ olitan area of Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of workplaces , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it because we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with colleagues and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , are constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La league may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not succ@@ um@@ b to N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has spark@@ ed the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world been warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G center player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse attacks reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , speaker of the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication in front of the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and contemporary Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the mayor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that when reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the attacks in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and it &apos;s a m@@ illed food . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take shelter from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became victims of aggression between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domains were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims fell victim to the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories of him in many cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reli@@ eves his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more tangible by the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musi@@ cally did not bring a top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all .
he is dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of its sphere of influence .
they can at best be accused of having experienced it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt by almost all those sur@@ vey@@ ed as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
in this way , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ined about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which even led to rage out@@ breaks .
the fact that he did not only cr@@ ush with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the ground , but also put ear @-@ cow@@ ard@@ ly and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he had already given years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers .
do you know such breeding methods too ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state Gymnasium .
compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed on him .
many who have never understood him in the Bavarian pop@@ e are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media in connection with the report a lot about the subject abuse was reported in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger laid down in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the domain master .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was all very embarrass@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims of shame are silent .
if they did not even famili@@ arise themselves with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
how do students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the abuse of abuse ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was calculated to him ... Bu@@ ben in@@ sist@@ ent or clearer or even more open than to their parents , boarding leaders , trust teachers etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that you talk about sex with him ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ think@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the display . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former mayor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and exc@@ esses and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is again a mis@@ use of the report .
there is , namely , clean separate : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and exc@@ esses as well as , we say , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole horrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys were governed by sa@@ di@@ stic teachers and suffered and suffered , all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only had to face the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that was , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : indeed , there was discipline , but not sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in whom the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims over@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus at most it remains the repro@@ ach to have looked at .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( if the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently eng@@ ul@@ fed the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , who even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that he will continue to practice the punishment in the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing fin@@ es were forbidden also in Bavaria for a long time .
before that , they took possession of a legal grey zone , as each of us knows .
it was difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but one cannot say that he always had looked out .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the prison sentence of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis affir@@ med that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time of that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we historians talk about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has already been right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times and not for what has been bre@@ ached in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally work out .
but at the same time I must shelter Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. to attract ear @-@ cow@@ ards and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of exam@@ in@@ ance also come to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I was by no means spar@@ ed that he led there a strict regi@@ ment there .
but that must once be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys do not even make a big singer and before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , gro@@ unded , deep @-@ believing and heart @-@ good people , of which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do a fly .
I get regular contact with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ tation , regularly hold contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until today that he was strictly to them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and worship them .
and please , once again clearly : everything you advance to it , are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the stand would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
