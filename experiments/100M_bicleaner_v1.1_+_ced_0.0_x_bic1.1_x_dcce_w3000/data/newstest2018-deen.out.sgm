<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, which is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former land of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows, who had to get upset, because the car-navi took a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and the first survey of Bavaria emerged.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave orders for a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide County of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove forward the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "the" "" "Urposiblatt" "" "for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found just like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the sendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller-sized map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered flurks from the so-called "original recording" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots still show no more farmers there - but small gardeners of the" "" "land in the sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized north of sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 o'clock of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or on the hill" "" "On the ventilates" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße there were once people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was in charge of setting up the institution - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the ankle of so-called" "" "Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from applying violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity did not suffice any more - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar, 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum in the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "- in architectural reference to the country of origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during WWII during bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "in 1856, called" "" "Kaufinger alley" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a series of questionable, rapid-based incidents in recent times occur throughout the state and can be noted here," says the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri Law, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents such as racist violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring the money or the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime program, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "" "" "the fence project is elementary" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidefence project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies in the right-grabbing court of the Schwendemann family together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest Milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales can be found on the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the President of Fisherbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary importance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area cares for a lot of work, much needs to be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leaders" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the reforestation of the areas could be pulled out quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers are often criticised for their support." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence support.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open conservation area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 Euro the half was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers had 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the gevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also stated:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveying backdrop marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "moreover, the fenced area must not be skippery (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing season 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build some 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-plan area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-immitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he resorted to its significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your idleness, your poor, / your oppressed masses, longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable" "" "waste was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn classical imagery.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great Schreider Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty invades anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative who brings the American flame into the world around: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh stumbled upon something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a matter of point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to light the way, but the hate that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400-m hurdles at its fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics about Facebook: do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore accused him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his haunless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side is a public forum which is designated as official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not full of hate, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I was courteous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't like this idea even if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the Governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call other" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest demonstrators or to silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County made the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed they were late to discover that they were mistakenly sent with guns, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - operated by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that younger travellers would rather disregard the rules.</seg>

<seg id="425">Now Musk clears: from the total of 518,000 preorders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of a cancellation, Tesla will pay 1000 Euro (in the U.S. 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such non-binding reservations are present, in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>

<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>

<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 bookings are required per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines with maximum capacity without any major interruptions in practice.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Authority, resigned its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit that was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a deadline which expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for the" "" "ozone" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable enemy of strict environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations to which chemical industry and industry are resisting fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal in ozone standards was simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive reconstitution of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius's Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tumours their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Wuerttemberg Documentation: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the document on Tumlinger Berg in addition to the former parish church was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the patronate law belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from the early medieval inchurch law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was associated with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two shrouded on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were inserted and the bell-parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to crash in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the bell tower and half overthrew.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent an evil, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>

<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only at the town border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200 meter high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, where the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-acre area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households should be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="684">Amount: usually in steinfurt at the furniture fair, once a week I help in Greven at the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I worked at school already in the open all day.</seg>

<seg id="908">The end of the building is planned for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal attachment that is also used as an operating route.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian path should be gone.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special tact feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crustaceans had to be fished initially.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football impact on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play Rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG must prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without big losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy rich ruler family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but they have to use legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively cheat and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency of the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly intensify the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the plan of redemption for the next five years will be reported in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsor's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come over payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar WM Ambassador will be sent and a such maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easily figuring out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and boycotting.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I call his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band's movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a popular TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court flat into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a passion for real estate, declined in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not grabbed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot long apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a storage room and an intermediate floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut up the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so it's very easy to slide the door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not fall into electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate markets Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the Brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to USD 85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her deceased father Colin - written by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin's property is valued at $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>

<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul into managing some possessions incompetent.</seg>

<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeansshop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"" "Colin says he started Westco there when he was" "" "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a steady course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: poor information put into the hands of the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television ranges back decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Trump was angry because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former electoral advisor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his associates manage to keep his anger away from him for a few times, their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may encourage their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "" "" "Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to lead dubious information to the president for strategic reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chicans, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has sold false accusations in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue was also received by the local tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective shelter, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of seriously interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with its headquarters in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affaires: U.S. Special Agent sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Special Agent Robert Mueller will have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In the past few weeks, the committee recorded the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper marked the step as a sign that Mueller widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already first announcements of the body in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accused of blending the Kremlin in a targeted manner in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focuses on several men who acted as consultants of the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller examined more and more Trumps private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that the special agent Trump had personally moved to the center and investigate whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible breakthroughs and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr., Trumps's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then election chief Paul Manafort were at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the substitution show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the onset of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump was to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the subject gives the democrats a way to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he didn't know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this work usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey told three times that it was not determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to believe that something has changed, it was said in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this reproach, accusations against Trump were loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to U.S. media, the White House gathered material against the special promoter and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special promoter of the congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later receding President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented the draft bill on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>

<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and abrupt was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shelf is broken down there, writes AWI scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far back as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be disassembled if a piece is broken down at one key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only in a small degree, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI-estimates, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest shelf of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is contested whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapses, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, there have been a lot of ice melts in the Antarctic Peninsula over the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed around three degrees during the last 50 years and counts to the areas in which the temperature is the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employer association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the Kreisel started to use 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are apparently very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places to be missed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At the moment there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces in general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "after the request of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for personnel extraction and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus internally and externally, demonstrate concrete actions for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is dominated by a" "" "competition by public employers" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1569">So the highest time for action so that there are not even more places left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Volkmar, head of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He was already worried about a bad surprise already in the Kreisel, when he publicly questioned the recruitment of personnel and bewildered the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be verified that enable an exit from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a house tariff," "" "said people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU seeks to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envisages the opening of the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that the crew will ship dinghy boats, which are delivered to them directly from traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who oversees their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles, rather than sweating through the stadium in wind and weather?</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract one could be far more often present online in these markets than to send the Federal ligaments to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-sport, computer games such as League Of Legends, "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation will be challenged at competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sport, the professionals have established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And by 2022 E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobous has also taken a long time dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For Professor at the German Sporthochschule Köln, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses, which can also be found in the classic sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also train their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1637">"" "but Frobous also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to play in online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were lacking.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist highlights the highly integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the move internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "write the Deloitte consultant.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW CEO said that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," and thus embarked on European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described undertakings as callbacks.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions standards.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of the car manufacturers to install exhaust gases from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rejecting the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several employees were indicted by Volkswagen, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former Head of Thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italians and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system in order to bypass the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request that was concentrated on the United States was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the winning of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted by diseases, what scientists and farmers, trying to find solutions, cause great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the past years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a little Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of it. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat to Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoc run normally on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest stop from violence, and while the corpses are hovering throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto put his office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoc, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodosiya building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodosiya, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are outrageous and although the ground is now more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoc in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoc, has broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003 he worked as an experienced reporter for noroeste, when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoc and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without hitting the poison poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoc, she was awarded the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever they were.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoc team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could fluke like a dockworker, a friend generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for the routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing ways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the employees of Riodoc met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoc in a four-story building in a mid-size quarters of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers, whom the governor himself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it's months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoc has made three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who listened to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption because of high-caliber cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they have never expected: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after killing Valdez, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since been asked to re-categorize her by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an equal society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were stuck under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21st 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy Earth.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you're blinking a bit with your eyes, you could almost believe it was sleeping," "" "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have discovered that these herbivores, although covered with an armor and similar to a changing tank, are probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-agate, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed us to move better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and borrowed Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to the fact that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure through flesh-eating dinosaurs that the evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of roe deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong pirate behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the chalk time," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21st 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the reserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"" "two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film" "" "Blacklive Matter" "" "in social media, identify themselves as gay." ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct has been splitting the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, from which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct marketing products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction works will be finished.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and Haaretz, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making publicly listed diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Because of the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment, not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette dumb and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse have become an unequal opportunity to exchange several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President of Chelub would judge, and she would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only had a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump introduces a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things happen for a particular reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of "automatic dispersion, whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written - a thousandfooter of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar, at least in a biological way, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as she shows up with a free-talk phone in the hand of the disciplinary kernels of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-ups race is on the lookout to help businesses find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, to offer specific groups and demographic groups, to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases permit whistleblowers to deal with the C-Suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tool is used by companies to measure employee commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Rett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuances where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the finance site Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity beginning this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has seized the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that handles its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has used more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that previously were hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practications.</seg>

<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Investors reach renders when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>

<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff according to your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotiate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have left too much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust won the full access until 2006 when the last heirs, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just when you thought that it can't be crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford-woman progressively look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they appeal to, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (here: conflicting) Farrah, trouble one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy complied with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it is said on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sextoy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep any sex robots, and while the FRR records their rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the boundary zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has braided over women to be sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the worn-out body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of trusted relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all reportedly trying to let our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet living in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it seems to me in another context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the primordial possibility that we will no longer repel his kitten.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump's republicans are "normalized" in the right wing, which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in fact occur as a very mild offence in comparison to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Parks, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perming music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-ties can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have judged the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store apologized, while I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain relocated from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first victim of death.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder that hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Investigation Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was noted that a kind of tolerance inducing immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>

<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerable, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been accommodated separately, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kind of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the intolerance-inducing cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>

<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>

<seg id="2855">GMB-Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerned with our members.</seg>
<seg id="2856">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is concentrated strongly on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The side of La league may regret their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not succumb to Neymar's persecution after having given an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has sparked the transfer window in the summer because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although a source near the Catalans board insists that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world been warned three years ago by the PSG president in front of this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse attacks relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," declared after publication in front of the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and contemporary Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the mayor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised the fact that when reporting on violence in the Domspatzen was measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In view of the attacks in Regensburg no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and it's a milled food."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "punches were a very normal educational tool" "" "in her youth," "" "to be done with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "totally wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take shelter from Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became victims of aggression between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domains were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims fell victim to the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories of him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence of Violence at Rainsburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which became more tangible by the Öfteren when a Domspatz musically did not bring a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger is present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses at the preschool were also expropriated outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">They can at best be accused of having experienced it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by almost all those surveyed as "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">In this way, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which even led to rage outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only crush with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also put ear-cowardly and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he had already given years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods too?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him in the Bavarian pope are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report a lot about the subject abuse was reported in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger laid down in the final report any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "I was all very embarrassed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims of shame are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even familiarise themselves with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do students evaluate Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it was calculated to him... Buben insistent or clearer or even more open than to their parents, boarding leaders, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that you talk about sex with him..." "" "unthinkable" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the display." ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former mayor Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, clean separate: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys were governed by sadistic teachers and suffered and suffered, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only had to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that was, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject of" "" "preschool" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: indeed, there was discipline, but not sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that" "" "many victims overestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus at most it remains the reproach to have looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (if the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently engulfed the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that he will continue to practice the punishment in the preschool." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing fines were forbidden also in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took possession of a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he always had looked out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the prison sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis affirmed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we historians talk about the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and not for what has been breached in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally work out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must shelter Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. to attract ear-cowards and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of examinance also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, that the Domspatzen only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I was by no means spared that he led there a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that must once be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone, the unruly boys do not even make a big singer and before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience with Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, grounded, deep-believing and heart-good people, of which one can't imagine that he could only do a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with how many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his emeritation, regularly hold contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today that he was strictly to them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: everything you advance to it, are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
