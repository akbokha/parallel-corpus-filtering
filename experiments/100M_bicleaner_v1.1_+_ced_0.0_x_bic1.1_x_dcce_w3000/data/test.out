28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim stated that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corp@@ se , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributed the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who had previously worked as a cook in Boston , took his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed by death &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss it sor@@ ely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his way to connect with his family was to cook for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lighted every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has the information will be asked to call the SF@@ PD on the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or glued on from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are more sn@@ u@@ g to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
most of all , the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of tel@@ ev@@ isions with sweet de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all @-@ educ@@ ating mother of two sons to see .
the film runs on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p at home to the trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he settled with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he was not even able to take photographs .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden sports pyramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master &apos;s winner was recorded in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the out@@ ings include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s what Clinton and Tru@@ mp want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental rather philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt small and cau@@ ti@@ ously warns how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive up regulations massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to do , it has disadvantage to open up opportunities and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
in order to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost the same .
the democratic candidate , the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , there could be party discussions on Tru@@ mp .
more clearly are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas ; it wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with its investment program and demands that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid better then , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a wage wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics argue that the fiscal deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , which at least wants to demand from the rich , is paying more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house is a refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
she put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized shel@@ ters for all @-@ embra@@ ced women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe in Munich .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because torture or death thre@@ aten them or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ bear@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons out@@ weigh the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are ste@@ aling away because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ isms , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers for example for a bottle of water require a sexual act is no r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who thinks that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , Ir@@ re tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this leads to the fact that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the Munich North are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodation for them , ask B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project as in Munich , some would answer with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodation of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or own homes in some community shel@@ ters only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or are men and women together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this need for protection can be seen at the cr@@ ush that it gives to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors : demands for new work campaigns
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ uties of the resident doctors called on their union to appro@@ ve new work @-@ action measures in their disputes with regard to a new treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had failed to deal with the concerns about the Treaty .
in July , assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which meant that the Treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today asked a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work campaigns that began in early September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck this year six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A resident Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be tri@@ mmed and he didn &apos;t radi@@ ate any heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan reiter@@ ated his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved like he would never have done anything bad .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s bright , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in its introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin sp@@ elled out and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia .
the decline was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received an ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could win a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat in almost his office last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
this week , the national television forec@@ asted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed to be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti stated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists are long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West , as the reaction to the attempted takeover of power is regarded as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment over the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this brilliant palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that have gone away from the West and feel badly treated and now f@@ rank .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have ri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey deliberately refra@@ ined from answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are at least talking to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Board of Management of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then the bank has dist@@ anced itself , when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing to Nat@@ West will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand among which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am saying now that we do not pursue global goals but local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ tions of the various brands in its sponsor@@ ing sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , who pays him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he placed a milestone at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who before won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori adop@@ ts the che@@ ering when he wins victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career chances
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a has inspired fans for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have brought 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat @-@ race for two decades .
it was annoying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said he wants to continue with cont@@ ests up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the stric@@ test confidence of Putin for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without giving reasons , Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been a deputy since 2012 , has been named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the vice director and chief executive of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of legislation and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow secre@@ tive .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest intimate Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
but the official claim - that a man who once was praised as a potential president at once would lead Russian environmental policy - came across great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust your job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
before that , he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term of Putin viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally Putin &apos;s ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he beat producer
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation on set of series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal .
on the set there came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how Gib@@ son &apos;s character from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be released at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who had previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned charism@@ a of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish landing in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around sandals that were sp@@ lined by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the cross @-@ country cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ t ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the cross @-@ country Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic size in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
a total of nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first shutter represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the gap to the north or the side of the country .
this has been achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity .
massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
uncle , as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
luckily everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown before Angl@@ es@@ ey from their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI b@@ ail@@ out station was on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blow the boat out of its reach , until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fisher@@ man , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a stop@@ over , but it loos@@ es the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched these men today .

this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met ex @-@ life companions of the man .

who is building up cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Green Party mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be forced much more in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first of all , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the affordable housing ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ man says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
however , the big dispute in the town hall is as follows : &quot; how do we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
regardless of that , as Brat@@ man , there is a worsen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire over the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
to prevent this , so the budget@@ ary spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought off @-@ going b@@ ind@@ ings from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing housing back to the price binding again .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem can be solved .
for in the West @-@ city , Fri@@ sten are running for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the West City is dr@@ astically increased , one removes oneself from the aim of so @-@ called interference .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect there will be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although this has concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside for playing but prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I naturally refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) emerged .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game brought a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 3@@ 5.000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look aw@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the miracle full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friend@@ ships in hunting .
as always there are also gru@@ mp@@ y play@@ things that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
there has been a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be slow@@ ed down with time .
because of poker &apos;s success , however , there will be more games to combine the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping many people to hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es manages gold in women &apos;s urine
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast opened on Thursday to the multi@@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ in Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tends to be on the floating beam during the individual multi@@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and in total the fifth , while consoli@@ dating her reputation , the best of her generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success is presented in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered disappointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi@@ campaign of women at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insi@@ sted that during their long journey to the top , never having planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling passport - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ trip in the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ a made easy by two turns , the picture dec@@ ep@@ ted .
floating beams and floor ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ed .
she got back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her practice she threw the audience into kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading tweet of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims shot into serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ held fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in his@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not true at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to see them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do it , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the aid of a help@@ aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
it can run with support and bike rides .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign that Ed@@ mund has thought about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing Me something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; explains Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inch rain to fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile Area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger as they are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9 : 00 .
rescue teams still kno@@ cked people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose over night strongly .
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer told us about 13.@@ 75 inches of rain near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was fully su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rain and road floods caused the saving of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ F reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa over@@ flooded 200 houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches that were now flooded .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals washed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up in order to accommodate the evacu@@ ated people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags were provided for residents to take part , hoping to be able to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his particulars , a handful of houses were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holes holes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survive shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital with his transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was kno@@ cked out of bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the broad@@ caster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ caster that he is likely to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four persons that were shot in German@@ town .
likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ se@@ wed the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continuous struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di told the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
there was no sei@@ zure and the police are currently re@@ viewing reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cri@@ b on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police still searches for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been there for every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Catho@@ lics , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally ech@@ o@@ ing the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three @-@ time world championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tik@@ routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see sports classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality looks like gymn@@ asti@@ cs is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts first and foremost in private gymn@@ asti@@ cs that can be maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ asti@@ cs are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started with the gymn@@ asti@@ cs .
we have to give the municipalities au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gym training .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ asti@@ cs in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ asti@@ cs that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ asti@@ cs develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance physicians want to organize more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors , who voted for election , rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t uncovered plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve care at non @-@ stop times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Commission for Assi@@ stance , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance physicians have raised serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and treat it to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talks strug@@ gled with the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened because Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to lift up the pressure and address the concerns of assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the resident doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in granting coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employee , urged the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work @-@ fighting measures achieve nothing of just little , but burden already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as deployment , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , further education and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were concerned with respect to agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the coag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form har@@ ms .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots release , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ logging the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE published today recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the appointment of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the widespread ignor@@ ing of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report revealed today .
Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former Cab@@ inet member , interven@@ es verb@@ ally the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored the evidence of election mis@@ use due to &quot; violations of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now an Ant@@ corrupt King , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of scri@@ b@@ bles to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should have a proof to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but should also protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election channel in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation where one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly alar@@ ming about the dec@@ eit@@ ful letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of ID cards to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence has been applied to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi &apos;s background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit postal voting documents to stop &quot; harvesting . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic postal code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition is that political activists are working to process full postal voting and envel@@ opes of postal voting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police give the authority to set up barriers for voting stations .
a change of legislation , which facilitates an accus@@ ation for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Distribution Act 1983 ) .
ban of photograph@@ ing in vot@@ er stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go to the election box alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court ruled Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ti@@ cking controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registr@@ ations of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ gers of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of the beaten track by Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , French cycling athlete Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proven to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by no means the only one who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger this summer - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary alike .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no big simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I believe it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her large expressive eyes is supposed to be a double @-@ tran@@ sit@@ ter for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ form and eyes
not the only one : a t@@ witter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the space provided : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and face .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is dead like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; went downhill &quot; like M@@ ief , &quot; and while racing like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style squ@@ ad@@ ron he gave his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald who had been brought aboard to the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
too excited , went like M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the Squ@@ ad@@ ron Squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get it that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ sty@@ ling squ@@ ad@@ ron for women in the following way : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many were talking about him
t@@ witter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
the comment@@ ator @-@ colleague Scott Rus@@ el ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly to our viewers on show and our torture in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to act as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I am very sorry . &quot;

she continued to rum@@ mage and tasted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , on .
the landmark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tasted the under@@ pants before she put it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she re@@ trac@@ ted the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to go back and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to be disturbed by observing someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to disgu@@ ise that someone would take home trousers home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull out the pieces of clothing after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman got her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your rob@@ ber .
if you are approaching from behind , you should turn around as a first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and get out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with his knee into the bar and turn the weapon out of his hands while the attack@@ er turns into pain . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with aggres@@ sors approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and turn it away so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it works to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master , it is most secure .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and saus@@ ages of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k put his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ man on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before le@@ aking each object he used a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ re to show himself and us what he will get in .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to drain the sink of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right addressed physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his Dar@@ ms by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations to fl@@ ushing toilets , the task of the immune system was definitely below a sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was certainly justified by his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial paint showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here , because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have ordered him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they should at least use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ating social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a dele@@ tion of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irre@@ parable condition .
the walls showed pla@@ in@@ ly holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and the police told the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation by residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
old tr@@ ash was found in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up .
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be inv@@ oked regularly by the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ed her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily .
the dele@@ tion was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t complain about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that it would have been sow@@ ing the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the crowded side of the community house
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept all responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ usion is always the last step taken into consideration Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have bol@@ dly responded to us and have given us the information .
I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the dele@@ tion on the floor
workers of the house administration will now have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after having found guilty of holding a class B drug in commercial law .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will del@@ o@@ ze rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row from De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police informed that the dele@@ tion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after an open military jet flies to the beach
suns@@ ets in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force put an incredible storm flight
the Air Force admitted that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no risk of security .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an open jet crash over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they were understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle drive , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane would drop down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese airline forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and so deeply flying that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to bad visibility conditions , the jet flew slightly deeper than usual , but the air strikes persi@@ sted on the fact that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on the island of Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese aviation forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the circumstances - strong fog and fire smoke - which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .

the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique , up to now , refra@@ ined from a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applications had the privilege .
before the first obligatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . did not really convince .
Sevilla again won the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in an own league with table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale .
thus the World Ranking First took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ gh@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the titles among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
the last non @-@ Chinese on top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in Time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had moved back to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches to this point have I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ al .
Ma had to fight only in the first sentence with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang out there only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected thrilling match .
nevertheless , there were still enough breath @-@ taking ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an was bred to a rib@@ bed injury , after that it had to be filled with sheet metal .

Donald Tru@@ mp grants ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose their majority .
Donald Tru@@ mp was now president of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ track and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts are now growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt was false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sm@@ iles .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US in June , Tru@@ mp and his rival from the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , were the same .
other institutions see Tru@@ mp in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the broad@@ caster CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not reach him at the end for reasons of political correctness , then this is fine , said Tru@@ mp .
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party is said to have threatened to cut money in support of his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would resort more strongly to the Congress under the arms .
Olympia : three @-@ day fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee will promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had indicated that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association examined the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man shared .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal given and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan &apos;s Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Cup fourth in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special surveillance for a long time at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing procedures .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was un@@ common that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
in consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control conform to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that , in Kenya , dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in the field of Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type was surface @-@ covering and systematic mut@@ opt .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins Meister@@ werk .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members with melanchol@@ y about her love with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and swe@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ans had gone to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they did at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had left to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other girls from East London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate , Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell , believes that the next President will appoint Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s successor to the late judge of the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have spoken to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge of the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to be a nu@@ di@@ st for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ at magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys differ , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the point of view that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany in the short term reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective hunters who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believed by the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the tough advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had previously covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with sanctions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the put@@ sch put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to re@@ press in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities .
that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he urged the German government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ ing as a Gü@@ len followers destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports by calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 percent of all recognised as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there are not those who wage war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament elections will not be held back directly at the end of the summer holidays , but the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because more stupid than so far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land elections - it bites .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on the shores of U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so do not have to choose the country day .
practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count votes in the end can only be lab@@ elled with difficulty .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over an election campaign just over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strong Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost invisible election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the land , spread roses and chat a little with the people , just as he did already his legendary word @-@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , Seel@@ ing has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives the blame for Af@@ D &apos;s blossom@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will presumably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its prime candidate , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time , one makes an election campaign at the right place .
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to big demonstrations twice ; Angela Merkel &apos;s administrative committee is in the northeast .
but the target audience did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you are forced to leave the base that it must be very strict , again to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the expan@@ se of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U sel@@ ector Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in the opinion p@@ olls , the Social Democrats la@@ gged at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD gained a clear victory at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday need and largely transfer their election campaign into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls it the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green electoral champi@@ ons embar@@ k on a search for local voters among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ts with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is san@@ iti@@ zed , there is nothing to complain about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which starts at 5.@@ 30@@ am and only ends at 8@@ pm there are all praise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty cris@@ p , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praise will also be the receipt of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site has been mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the resort has eased .
the citizens can now proceed from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ len@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ ws were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks are fra@@ ying in residential areas .
since the speed limit has not been comp@@ lied with , the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself clear on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have already been two to three per minute .
the fastest was at 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers in the tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become more quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to a loss of sales in them allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus have no consequences for other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the imp@@ eller is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he forecasts sales revenue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has thrown back its business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , replied that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where such gener@@ osity has been handled .
at all complaints G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it &apos;s also very nice .
that his stem @-@ clim@@ bers come back after the restoration works , but G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crisis with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
all the time , in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are bol@@ ted to laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thick security package &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iled person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t ask anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in that .
but as Minister of the Interior , he was on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has stopped a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some are already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nor is the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on passenger data and arms legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cle@@ ars the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that does not have any chances with the coalition partner .
a few new ideas are presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more ways of det@@ ecting people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted specifically into the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of Dul@@ ce for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as comm@@ itting crimes or rej@@ ecting their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sensitive .
some of them also have an effect on them and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the im@@ treatment of tolerated for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of high refugee numbers .
and things that were deeply involved in people were not allowed to clas@@ h even in campaign periods .
the inner security has moved tremend@@ ously into the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral struggles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly concerned with internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , the two parties went high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ sti@@ tious dispute on the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Ministers , in which the department heads also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also te@@ dious here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he thinks nothing of a departure from the double @-@ pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made a short @-@ term discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ juven@@ ate , do not make sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in case of a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitutional and whether it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it has yet to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could cause disputes .
but also the SPD is trying to profit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel only sign@@ alizes cau@@ ti@@ ously and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still able to get off lightly .
in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery figures are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the recall action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vor@@ tex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is about a term . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with the deliveries .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening especially in Western Europe and thus reli@@ ed on the total sales , as announced by the company in D@@ ax .
in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles compared to the previous year &apos;s month .
sales alone in Western Europe , China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries bag@@ ged almost a sixth .
sales leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , above all on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has given a discount . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also stressed a female spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gases escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus to beech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the main affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is already lightly affected by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler continued his sales up from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software emission test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling some 2.5 million vehicles for conversion to the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after converting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer offers the customer a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after conversion , but not talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for this is legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed by Volkswagen representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion have no deterior@@ ations and all vehicle values relevant to the type of vehicle have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was stated in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example half a year after the conversion , customers might come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in customer interest it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , a uncertainty regarding possible guarantees will occur as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their as@@ par@@ ag@@ us punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks invest money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties .
as of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund requires private and corporate accounts for deposits amounting to over 100,000 euros on sight or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he be@@ ware 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and that he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banking director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs now continue .
leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s v@@ aults would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already seen four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the CFO .
most customers would have understood and changed to other investment forms .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association of co @-@ operatives declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry them alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational dur@@ ably not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore raised their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele equipped with a little more opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they keep money free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently has no other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said narr@@ ator Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared : &quot; the threshold to go into negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not like this in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men of middle aged love plates .
before you rush to comment section to re@@ sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ue men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re@@ emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ ffed , before I stand , hold my hands and tell something about something like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I came from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
these vinyl records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I do not drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 who works with Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers that he meets will meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media @-@ pump , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and will see to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have led , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to supporters of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that evoke happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think that it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a record stack fl@@ aps out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smoo@@ ther through a pile of bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone just came in here recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put it on a shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who only slowly come in .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a low audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer and sex@@ en@@ pack@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but psychiat@@ ric trau@@ mas are difficult to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
it &apos;s rather a window @-@ bum@@ ble than a big buy @-@ in .
it does not deserve much , so collecting disks is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I &apos;m preten@@ ding to get the jeans pants pants , I watch a group of young teen girls who are grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some are so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for lux@@ uries such as plates .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave un@@ accounted for at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who sticks out of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects quotation on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle in which thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to submit 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which have a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate 72 provisional shops , but admitted that the concerns of Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ drop was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is run for profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that closure would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the J@@ ell@@ ell@@ ager had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer .

he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he needed to analyse the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Championship in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which are to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in case of accidents , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure that there is a steady speed limit for the observ@@ ance of the speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement operations , and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits and access b@@ ans according to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling .
so that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also slip @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic information in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 units last year .
Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ star ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ day Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro Stadium .
Fiji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic med@@ al@@ lion of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fiji had defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de of Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they lost only one .
this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and had fun boun@@ cing off the G@@ Bs .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . at , as if you were running in running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au grab@@ bed in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a pres@@ et sni@@ ffer from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped .
in the seventh minute athlete Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right hand corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ attachment and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
that &apos;s how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant interim play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the dot on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged himself and GB ki@@ cked out cr@@ ammed in the law@@ ns .
earlier on that day , Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als at 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown took the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than in those games , and that wants to be hot .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was present when they rowed the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports who made such a measure .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ fired use , which is also un@@ paralleled .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes gli@@ ding across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and there was no one more instrumental than the coach , who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing itself is a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ awakening morning in order to talk a little more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was a cent@@ uri@@ on at the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said : &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week .
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was in the original sound of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia killed the con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the Association of Emplo@@ ye@@ es for 31 years , was 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water every year and provides 32 places and a hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget@@ ing planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the flood containers ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the reconstruction of water pipes .
there has been no down@@ time and there have always been new innovations because water lives and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech , she commen@@ ded Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has engaged himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has regularly lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia region .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ cher and he was a faithful kn@@ it .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the pipe rup@@ ture at the high @-@ level can@@ ister near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can once only be maintained , because it was filled with hoses from P@@ ett@@ stadt .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly talks to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease had been detected by her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the meanwhile eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now study privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something about two years when I sang at the Milan Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on partner of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and declared to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him become public prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a lat@@ ch .
meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon , so the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to provide information on the day of the day or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing delic@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special assignment command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick für Deutsche Stah@@ el
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed additional costs for millions .
financial burdens that thre@@ aten the industry from green electricity promotion are from the table .
it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Sour@@ ces of the German Steel Industry , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent will fall .
but even this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
this makes the status quo of the current regulation largely written .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weighed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw off price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation was somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel effect , on the other hand the economic outlook in China has slow@@ ed down .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices had rather stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to not exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the crowd went back for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
the association expects an improved order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does good sen@@ iors
the singing was accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by the way , she does something good about her health and spirit .
for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describing H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
anyone who calls his lungs on a regular basis is not so fast in everyday life as quickly out of the pu@@ dding .
even if it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Association of Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers tend to fall back on long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm at the same time and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler means .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I do a long time for something , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - in 50 singing people , who can hear when a tone is next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone is singing from the circle of acquain@@ tances in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surroundings .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the Internet search .
if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ bly as han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the effect of cats has on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ sty also did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression level of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great distress , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males are also responding to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - though always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten cries differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were pre @-@ played for a herd of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ment of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males react at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly tested the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
also , some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ dek@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ dek@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ ets between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the suspension of the state of emergency after the fall of the emergency in July , the government regre@@ ts that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be impaired .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it doesn &apos;t stop before the football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ dek@@ r .
accordingly , the South America living now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ dek@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
in fact , the state of emergency handed down for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact this has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at tro@@ phy winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will especially arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne season presented its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top@@ scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and assured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Champions League &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also say goodbye early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the South of Li@@ g it was only sixth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal figures as the South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher King laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez bor@@ rowed from the Treaty of Florence under the treaty and announced to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country , not to return after his European holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man .
but in order to do this , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man realized : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin was banned twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other surviving athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the theme of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined after a dop@@ ing lock just before the games , became mer@@ cil@@ essly whi@@ st@@ led and retired at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a bizarre scene : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still stum@@ bled into the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was established that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a rush storm .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start in spite of the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , and is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest challen@@ ger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit in 2010 for a six @-@ month lock after the pain was taken by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , and the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion in 2013 and European Championship , was positively tested for the banned drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied know@@ ingly and was locked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic winner and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , mut@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world for 200 and 400 m .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athlete has been removed as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having been found in him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ings and the 2006 European titles due to testosterone abuse .
he was also awarded a bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of Justice CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record player and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world cup , po@@ inters were found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran off on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Viol@@ ence injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ days early .
she suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday night in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
at the beginning of the day two sy@@ ring@@ es went up again and another man was killed according to the authorities .
ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured at the det@@ onation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country then another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive set had gone into the air in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
finally , there were several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it was a question of the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , explained that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities would have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days , but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely minor bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bom@@ b@@ astic bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for necessary trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were carried out a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the jun@@ ta .
this gives great influence to the military in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted at the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ties Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court of Justice Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so immigrants in Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; the loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely aligned with the authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the protection of the Constitution , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point onwards .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , is the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the marked increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this respect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler group .
it may well be that other ri@@ gh@@ tist groups or groups of small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee he@@ aders or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a Germany @-@ wide or pan @-@ European control of rights @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried , Ma@@ ate expressed that many acc@@ esses went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the suspi@@ ci@@ ons of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or chose CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have become radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympics or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that he could temporarily no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite afterwards .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more familiar .
as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ auch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , there was no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from A@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea was an unforgettable one , when he had to compete alone on one of the 100 metres fre@@ estyle .
m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learnt only eight months before Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so close
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is talking about an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
losing Donald Tru@@ mp won the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will work either , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television broad@@ caster CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not reach him at the end for reasons of political correctness , then that is fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
mail increases in trade with electric @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the Group will soon want to launch trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters from the next year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed sco@@ ot@@ ers , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be shipped to other companies .
post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in its own fabrication , the company is planning to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ der announced that the Group wanted to significantly enlarge its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are switching the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
Gf@@ K guided tour ki@@ cks off after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ ors came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann to become even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five in the industry faces a new beginning .
G@@ RP Executive Chef wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , will already reti@@ re from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
the management board of the Executive Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ inger on September 1 , and distributed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive vice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a business spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be the market research company in future , is still unclear at this time .
it was said in An@@ le@@ ger@@ sk on Friday , with the shareholders last the disappointment of the continuing success of the restructuring introduced years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder becomes un@@ quiet at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case at BMW , that would also make the quot@@ a so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.@@ 1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s previous year .
in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales of € 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million shr@@ ank by 3.4 per cent .
the profit in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the company &apos;s s@@ unken value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the Group &apos;s value amor@@ tization of EUR 139 million , which has become necessary in the Consumer Experience division , earned the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in the event of an accident of a tour with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , distributed the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their specifications , had to avoid an out@@ coming truck , which partly drove on the reverse .
the bus arrived right off the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident location on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to contact the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the charges per cubic metre of waste water will amount to 2,@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high @-@ level calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach confirmed that Unter@@ deck@@ sburg was established for these sewage systems .
due to legal grounds , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board , a re@@ calculation of fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ covers from the preceding calendar period are also to be equ@@ ated .
Schmidt &apos;s gravi@@ metric increase in fees is that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewage systems with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the sewage volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , all three plants were not least due to their age due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant .
in the pumping station Wel@@ thi@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first sewage pond had to be dispos@@ ed of after nearly 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level with the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that the costs for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully penet@@ rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three plants were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully penet@@ rated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Schmidt , the market community has been spar@@ ed from major entertainment costs in the sewage systems over the past 20 years .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the mentioned systems will remain prec@@ arious , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the sewage @-@ purpose association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal in order to not extend these facilities because it is a lack of emergency facilities .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , that is , the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods were observed compared with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already del@@ im@@ ited by the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , feature @-@ twist tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carri@@ ages arrive to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critici@@ zed in the past where they were accused of using black@@ face conveyor or white skin as beauty ideal .
when it suggested a filter to some users this week , who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature .
the company had an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced r@@ r@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others decisi@@ vely rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et@@ ers were widespread over the photos , that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and least to say uncomfortable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it would be difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been moved into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling dragon .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ er in terms of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters generates an image that is offensive for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such items remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , chose to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , and called on others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that ras@@ sen@@ related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ ameri@@ can Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu , for her part , said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if she needs more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as if the actual conditions were allowed on site , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ can Committee , intelligence committees and the military budget , reports great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically enjoyed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated .
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed challenges in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government officials have given orders under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in their lives after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com are underway through the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday , meeting some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this trial , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention at the Cent@@ com analy@@ st with regard to a certain political opinion .
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor who received complaints from Cent@@ com analysts .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor is still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts at times have diver@@ gent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the cre@@ denti@@ als on the Islamic State is reminiscent of the pressures of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a scrip@@ ture about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government agencies , that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK stands before
one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember to have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not part of the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man a little longer out of the way that leads the other group .
as always the game starts on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ schlä@@ ger in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympic Games in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work place in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder to be able to rip off completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone into the game without winning the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball to the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and inevitable , a fast relay competition between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the Cross@@ bow to the Tur@@ ner to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of dim@@ ples , could well have been under these known names , which are sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may it reign long .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney since 2000 , it was perceived so spar@@ sely the last 16 years that many people I had asked didn &apos;t know that it is an Olympic portal at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping and had had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of its never ending impact - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ asti@@ cs and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ bo@@ under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up @-@ and @-@ coming vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are assessed according to official Olympic program according to design , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another highlight in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympic ch@@ ords .
the goal @-@ oriented quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel more ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she jumps off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympics Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Ang@@ us and the objectiv@@ ity of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its new fan base according to air .
&quot; one generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters who demand political changes in Ethiopia viol@@ ated the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dirty prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at fire@@ arms .
is Ethiopia just to collapse ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West , with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people r@@ ushed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen fired on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security men hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa &apos;s Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , and dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the governing coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ pi@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front des O@@ ga@@ den , who have been more or less forced in recent years , will protect and re@@ arm the tur@@ mo@@ il .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess will explo@@ de beneath the surface after years of intro@@ sp@@ ection .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved .
even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside .
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians showed that they were so hot@@ ly gathered .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ chi and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ chi and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from eth@@ op@@ i@@ ens mainly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ chi , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ z@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ z@@ mos feel that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethi@@ op@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ public illness in 2012 .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively opa@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections which , according to the reports of analysts , were apparently sealed by the government and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s guide for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , run by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West wants to clearly support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin line of grass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings his fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ or to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of explaining statements he could not have meant at all .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp insi@@ sted on the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted on the fact that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate would not know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism le@@ aks down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand figures .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
reporting on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Natur@@ ally , I felt sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then to rec@@ la@@ im as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an et@@ ched tone , as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a major lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent agents , had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s testimony whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ banks , completely false , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by allowing them to aggres@@ sively control the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ologies as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once pushed over the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , due to the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front it was sup@@ planted .
So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people took it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ term employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered to provide money for a new out@@ source , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same bul@@ bs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ers like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural bowls .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb closed she gave up the coffee drinking a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably den@@ ounced the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he didn &apos;t find a res@@ ent@@ ment about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tends to issue them soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ baked coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the bri@@ m felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell that , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ reed soup .
his menu on this day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; Jane Ziegel@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small liqu@@ or snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District which has been in business since the IP@@ O crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter ordered Hack@@ roast , this found the pair suitable for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; says Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
men of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; marks the way with which the country was dealing with it , not to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ using food residue , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man noticed that coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange mixtures have been tried as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy common sense .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since then , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - assumed the eating habits of the country .
by publi@@ ci@@ zing prescri@@ ptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge to turn pamp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical ti@@ d@@ bits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hi@@ ring of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded once the country got back on its legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
in writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick one remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did indeed sick people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind bag incident .
after the plates were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe , which President Roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved somewhat reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E got three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a drum attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group , which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to attract people from bombs and to first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Defence , which showed him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby out of the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average just 1.@@ 220 metres wide .
only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a plan for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ bare from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist thought long ago that Greenland sh@@ arks become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to watch , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sh@@ arks .
her slow @-@ motion seemed to them , when they extended six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
loo@@ t make this shar@@ k nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the greatest 50@@ 2 inches measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular heart .
therefore , their birth should lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons in@@ ert large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Greenland sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucleus , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers is even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the reproduction obviously have at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose neck at the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on top was stuck , was captured in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on spar@@ se flame .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal is losing heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ bare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life .
construction site in double pack
the municipal council has dealt with topics relating to construction in the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board received the message from mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after clari@@ fying the land , par@@ zel@@ li@@ zing and closing issues and the applications for sur@@ veying , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; Strasbourg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) is no longer in the way for interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and the elderly alike .
as it was said , building wil@@ lows can report in the town hall right away , the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to also request inquiries for the settlement of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the area &apos;s plans newly created in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the trade zone already designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether monetary houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval is enough for them in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is using just large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg indeed conce@@ als a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin loses more of its infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
the city also points to the readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands on seventh place , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the IC@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my economic researcher .
in the end of 2015 , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C Patent Disp@@ ute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a damages deposit amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead stood , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct from mer@@ ck , including the opinion of opinion and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was raised on Thursday , U.S. officials in Beth @-@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to con@@ strain with Gilead that dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck inter@@ ming@@ led each other and took possession of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
supported by the United States , the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left it , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are cur@@ tail@@ ing the city after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council re@@ mor@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return on Friday for 2015 , resulting in USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the French Pres@@ idential candidate and her husband .
in 2015 , Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged by law because of it .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the democr@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish anything before the tax audi@@ ts were not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already reported that his refusal issues with regard to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business @-@ aries and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp requested his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the topic also during a speech on the business in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co reported that during the 1990s Tru@@ mp had paid no or very little taxes for two years , and an economic journalist in the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton is supporting a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters , Tru@@ mp at a meeting to share their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an IR@@ S tax audit and Tru@@ mp was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns until 2007 .
Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ ted an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Clinton &apos;s tax returns from 2015 showed that they were only $ 100 in their income as a salary , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going inhabited by humans - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ds .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , has intensified its funding together with the US conservation team by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and crops without inj@@ uring animals .
before that , many spec@@ ters have used to defend themselves .
Friday is a world calling day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change of attitude within these communities , with much more confidence that they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ guide D@@ ami@@ an Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch quite usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a final option is a thro@@ wer that shoots a golf fire@@ work into the air and causes a loud , light explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed position on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashing Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed by &quot; Arab &quot; sum@@ mons - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uprising after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed any Israeli pre @-@ election since it had requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s country code list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
searching for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind solved even more wrath in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cler@@ k was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the Internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some presented the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged re@@ forest@@ ation of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not get into the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber missi@@ les against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police replaced tear gas and rubber missi@@ les against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to police rub@@ bing rubber missi@@ les and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti on walls spra@@ yed against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er .
the recent protests occurred several days after prot@@ esters in masses went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies increased strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador divided .
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran , while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade up@@ swing was achieved through deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan continues this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign representatives issued around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : beverage market covered in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL was practi@@ sed at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the su@@ sten@@ ance of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had mut@@ ed their faces from the employee of the beverage market took the money out and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured , the police do not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators must have fled towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and , from the gravel car park located opposite the park entrance , may be fled with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the N@@ uss@@ old children &apos;s shelter with their assistants during their summer holiday in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quietly situated leisure theim hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school .
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rette with the visit of the stro@@ king z@@ oos .
to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing .
for culinary purposes , children and car@@ egi@@ vers were spoiled with their own body@@ work such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
the workshops were made to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the journey home the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Por@@ te of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on the way to a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were overcome .
in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in the fores@@ eeable two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ te round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
several pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to become the Epis@@ cop@@ al town of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage goal was offered to the open portal of the mercy of Freiburg Münster .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms , arose in the way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and told the Pil@@ gri@@ mage .
from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Min@@ ster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual day@@ trips were framed in the morning and evening , each with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the min@@ is made ra@@ xes at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a delicious as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we continued through Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , one took the stage to St. Peter , which was the exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to take some 500 metres of altitude in the course of high school and then to be heard again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
the Min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy in the later afternoon at Freiburg &apos;s Münster and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is arrived at the evening mass in Münster were greeted by the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the metrop@@ olitan metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ sts last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the velo@@ drome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ ump and made the legend proud when he came home to visit a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in London despite the Ho@@ ys reg@@ ression in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who were victorious four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualification round an Olympic ch@@ ord , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders prevailed in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ der was just behind , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , moving in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked out from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we have set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the final round and the World Champion is defeated .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys page , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped off on the track .
he later re@@ trac@@ ted this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined as a team over the past three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23rd March ( apparently sacred date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next to the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had argued with officials prior to the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will continue tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a band of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama in the background played out in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ b@@ bling , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its climax for the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium mol@@ ten from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers &quot; workplaces - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus canc@@ els all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dis@@ ed for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in the majority owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L believes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; said the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L believes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual subscription of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before possible closure of the Port@@ land melt plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity every year .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it would not be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan . Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , and the fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , sung reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ ha@@ iry action of almost every birthday sep@@ tic of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in this publicity for her other girls .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , surely a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference which is more similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue pul@@ ls a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of its cover stars is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years , the magazine has yet to se@@ ep pictures of the magazine before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she finds herself in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though everything is based on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the Mist@@ ress of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings revi@@ ved again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to reach the point of dis@@ grace seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of them on their pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centres annually assign 160@@ ,000 people annually
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ aries are rejected annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further central short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ sts and the like - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly used , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the Director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l community centers said that the last survey of the National Union of Community Research Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the federal government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal law centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and cr@@ ushing debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ justified - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the federal government will cut the resources by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these mid @-@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their clients , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp Ele@@ ction Campa@@ ign indic@@ ted after employees allegedly drew weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had sent a fire@@ arm to a staff in February , while in February they were traveling in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Landes@@ gericht of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run into Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had made the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate released a rebellion when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judges appoint judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ur violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty duty and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s Press spokes@@ woman Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip did likewise failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
so far , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tru@@ mp For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD crashed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iles just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens went back to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite moderate losses ( prior to 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be present at the Land@@ tag ( 3 per cent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the survey , according to the survey , the SPD of the survey estimated that only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U achieved only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still lies behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , but the pirates would not miss it in comparison with 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes initially , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months ago at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an office in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , even though tor@@ menting slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was very proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , ie . 1400 Euro .
the average sales price for a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone saver of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today the market dominate vendors who came all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that &apos;s everyday for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough in the mass market came first in 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World the launch of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all easily accessible via touch screen .
the triumph of Apple began , the iPhone is still the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had a look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ a@@ throws , just as in 2012 in London , when we used a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions were benef@@ iting from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we will have 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces alone , 40,000 new jobs will create and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will end .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlar@@ ging He@@ a@@ throws is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion , and a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and to the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to bring this Olympic spirit to He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ ole &quot; regarding ad block@@ age
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad block@@ ade are the same as a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it told users that users could update their filters in the program to re@@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that its Des@@ k@@ top@@ side would modify the coding regarding its adver@@ ts to make it more difficult to detect , which part of the page advertising is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in and Her battle between the appearing open source community and the hang@@ ers has been in progress since the invention of scor@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying displays for the industry have become .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times so much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has been using ad block@@ ers on Desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a big share of revenues so Facebook appears to be worthwhile investment of such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences Tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get people more control over it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control into the hands of people .
woman having suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call upon witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was transferred to a highway at a presum@@ able suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 years , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , asked to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the motorway , as stated in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after having passed and killed a man who was in August 2014 of a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had replied to a call - ran into a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly rot@@ ated .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day@@ time in the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this he@@ ats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a story of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously thought by planetary researchers .
although it once was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to excess heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
when its hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low participation right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy commented in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I have been thinking much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Coach of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last years the night season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of five points behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadian and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ckers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles in relation to wages for North @-@ sea workers are exposed , while all the conflic@@ ting parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of un@@ winding the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company have the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in what connection the rotation periods with planetary origin are standing .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
you are now turning to the fastest .
at peak rotation rates these mature stars encounter large amounts of star winds .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more mass@@ aging stars rotate slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , both younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot to learn about what we like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates , and so to speak hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old pro will wear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ times All @-@ Star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be working as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed several mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the hall of glory of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal , he was blocked for 211 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the principal suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I &apos;ve played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends play the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; adds Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy @-@ con@@ fes@@ sions from the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ als Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing .
a learned athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the pre @-@ operations of more than 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing has been applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news of the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova was le@@ aking , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said that the banned substance will be the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism to the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus , for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , especially the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another severe blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world federation had forbidden the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the Kenya L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming sport , in addition , the earlier depar@@ tures in China caused fierce disputes between the athletes .
thus , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang hard .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to surrender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been positively tested for the stimulus tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in the Chinese nation@@ als in 2014 but had to sit down just a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
black@@ mail programmers are currently targeted at companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims readily paid the ran@@ som fees demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to send ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently observing a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the last few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an victim , it searches specifically for recently changed files such as word , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies rely on sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage goes out when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of affected German companies reported loss of sales due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany already several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ time in operation .
the hack@@ ers again know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the use areas and contact with black@@ mail users and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free @-@ to @-@ access support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files .
and if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros , businesses have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , says safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that it is three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware kits have been created by the malware themselves , providing advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price range between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail coaches then look for further hack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and mand@@ ates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then super@@ v@@ ise sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators already pursue new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators instead thre@@ aten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the potential of damage , depending on the type of data , is still a multiple higher than before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the hack@@ er@@ konferenz de@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such block@@ aded heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V only has a small impact of only 1.@@ 60 m , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , but only the cockpit @-@ top is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high up and 10@@ 26 l at revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk is well loaded , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V extremely powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges .
however , he is likely to perform a bit more quietly to his work .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is enjoyable .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works by speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane maintenance assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the smart speed control re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed when required .
however , full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and can therefore be easily reached .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are al@@ right .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line does not stick : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is only conceivable for dangers that are typical for aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a common risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of a trial a family had difficulty passing through and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip had been so poor - and was compla@@ ining about the organizers .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the purification plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer only learned shortly before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ff .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to react to terror .
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , this will increase the security and strength , as well as the consent of the people for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals to the Bundestag election in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire will be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be maintained according to De Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers better social support .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
for the prosecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against Action@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality previously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t for@@ bid what you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green manager Simone Peter accused the Minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate action and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
&quot; &quot; &quot; it st@@ ole regularly on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Um@@ geh@@ ungs@@ straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - here a picture of November . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this shall change : the legal proceedings shall be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the traffic jam when driving across the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler road the right bending track by 700 meters .
drivers can then flow directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the major advantage : traffic jams early on , whereby the total number of orders is improved on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder makes driving more nervous especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ log extends to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason for this is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler road .
from here , traffic is guided only in a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rec@@ laimed a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected working traffic jam will last , the responsible state company cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining time of remaining till 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal insurance policy , the country has deliberately chosen the traffic weaker times during the school holidays because of disability .
traffic is passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday lane on the job@@ site .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the youth of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Junge Theater Münster .
the club N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ kel , and the young theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
given the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany a stroke through the bill on Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory of Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ schu@@ ppen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are per@@ sei@@ ds , which belong to the fastest star @-@ trun@@ ks with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleeping any more in the morning .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be a variety of reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what one understands is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an on@@ e- and sleeping @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance .
especially the sleeping feel many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board in the German physician association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , We@@ eß gives an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with a doctor ?
those who are not sleeping well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , gu@@ esses gu@@ esses .
the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily symptoms such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
in Germany , there is hardly any hospital in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , when dealing with sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advises Weber .
it can be clari@@ fied whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
in order to investigate in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise doctors , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , in case of illness , for sleep conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , &quot; Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make no@@ on@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sti@@ cking , one goes to bed at his normal time .
apart from the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws on the sleeping end at the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws for a better sleep .
the shot counts on : regular sleeping and standing periods , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler comments on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he made gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself from his ex @-@ team@@ mates standing in criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € premium and a jungle kö@@ nig of 150@@ ,000 € no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the transport system in swimming sport is poor , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; whoever cannot control a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream .
airport : ban@@ de arrested by Bag@@ gage Di@@ vers
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
civilian flag@@ stones of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the suspect had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ eman from past theft crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and have been involved in a collaborative , professional and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Investig@@ ate Committee 34 can demonstrate four acts that have been submitted to Germany for the prevention of crimes against Germany .
at the same time , they had taken over 15,000 euros altogether .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between , still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Road in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ hain doesn &apos;t work like that , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichs@@ hain calls , is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior broad@@ caster H@@ enkel has repeatedly expressed itself in favour of a hard action by the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after evacu@@ ating the premises on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers on June 22 , the police pat@@ rol official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
at the time of its renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house owners , the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers pulled away from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who plays three children here , is gener@@ v@@ t above all from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who wished for a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior designer and the police make between house @-@ occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichs@@ hain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which in comparison to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk .
in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the part of the city has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and scri@@ b@@ bles from all over the world over the past few years : now residents from GDR times and former home occup@@ iers share their neighbourhood with them .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on raised slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been tos@@ sed with coloured bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against police officers .
most of the crimes make damages which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is most important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they were certainly not .
the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga for a long time .
for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the R@@ ī@@ ga Street - and remains .
that is why it was so important for her that the locals get back to their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the Deut@@ ungsh@@ oh@@ eit about the district .
however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well cared for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for dra@@ ins who are anno@@ yed by color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ wing scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who travel should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub district , can complain badly about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked to not be called with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the Refu@@ ge@@ e Commissioner for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group for refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ laying lust for wool , which above all has a problem .
this meant that some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
he was looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in social work , just an aff@@ lu@@ ent Woll@@ m@@ k@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has fixed a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and minor problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there will be new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the delivery .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be carried by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Department of Agriculture to the Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
in fact , the administration does not have private apartments .
so far , it doesn &apos;t work to rely on private dwell@@ ings , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community apartments must be tested as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ strasse .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fixed or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine client reports .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus also here administration and honorary content jump .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it will take and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling , he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are also problems , says customer honest , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the latest happ@@ enings fear radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would call them completely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always been in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself .
actually , it is unfair to place them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine client also makes clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy to integrate the previous people reasonably .
these are currently about 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
