<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "gold pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they hunted at the fast gallop at home to the troughs.</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He settled with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he was not even able to take photographs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been supporting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master's winner was recorded in the" "" "Hall of Fame of German Sports" "" "on Saturday." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">The outings include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum der Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - that's what Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep in doubt small and cautiously warns how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive up regulations massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "" "the state has certain tasks to do, it has disadvantage to open up opportunities and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate, the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government-critical Teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, there could be party discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">More clearly are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas; it wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "on the other hand, Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with its investment program and demands that" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should be paid better then," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a wage wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the fiscal deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, which at least wants to demand from the rich, is paying more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs set up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Frauenhilfe in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "deputies of the resident doctors called on their union to approve new work-action measures in their disputes with regard to a new treaty." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers had failed to deal with the concerns about the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the Chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "persistently quiet" to problems, which meant that the Treaty was rejected.</seg>

<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today asked a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work campaigns that began in early September.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of war of words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be trimmed and he didn't radiate any heat, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved like he would never have done anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's bright, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in its introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin spelled out and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decline was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed in a failed coup d "état in almost his office last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the national television forecasted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed to be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti stated it as follows:" "" "tourists are long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West, as the reaction to the attempted takeover of power is regarded as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continued resentment over the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this brilliant palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described: two countries that have gone away from the West and feel badly treated and now frank.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they wouldn't even have ripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately refrained from answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are at least talking to each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "IVANOV was part of the strictest confidence of Putin for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin, it is said that without giving reasons, Putin ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been a deputy since 2012, has been named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is (in Russian) that he later became the vice director and chief executive of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he told Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of legislation and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secretive.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest intimate Vladimir Putin's and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was praised as a potential president at once would lead Russian environmental policy - came across great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust your job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term of Putin violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the cross-country Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic size in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first shutter represents a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the gap to the north or the side of the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">This has been achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Green Party mean:" "" "investors should be forced much more in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "concept of action" "" "for the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D Group president Christoph Bratman says:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the big dispute in the town hall is as follows: "how do we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem is as follows:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions right now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of that, as Bratman, there is a worsening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will expire over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, so the budgetary spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought off-going bindings from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about bringing housing back to the price binding again.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem can be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the West-city, Fristen are running for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased, one removes oneself from the aim of so-called interference.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the Greens expect there will be movement in the discussion." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside for playing but prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been lamed by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs) emerged.</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found" "" "photographed" "" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "" "captured" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game brought a considerable rise in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person restores each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35.000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health, people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look awful." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle full of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friendships in hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also grumpy playthings that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be slowed down with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of poker's success, however, there will be more games to combine the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people to hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast opened on Thursday to the multicampaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalliin Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles tends to be on the floating beam during the individual multicampaign of women in the gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and in total the fifth, while consolidating her reputation, the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success is presented in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected her last examination in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted that during their long journey to the top, never having planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passport - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a schooltrip in the gymnasium in which Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa made easy by two turns, the picture decepted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and floor urns - in which Biles holds the world title - laued.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got back with 15,433 on the floating beam again - and on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly as she expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Oma" "", "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her practice she threw the audience into kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been there for every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, which is Catholics, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally echoing the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three-time world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American, who won gold in an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see sports classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts first and foremost in private gymnastics that can be maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the municipalities aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thanks, you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness lets electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on the appointment of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the widespread ignoring of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report revealed today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sir Eric Pickles, former Cabinet member, intervenes verbally the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored the evidence of election misuse due to "violations of ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Communal Government, who is now an Antcorrupt King, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of scribbles to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should have a proof to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter only needs to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person's finger if they release their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistle-blowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this is not only for election fraud, but should also protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that accompanies it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election channel in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "" "in cynical ways," "" "and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman should have led" "" "his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation where one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was particularly alarming about the deceitful letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guiding of ID cards to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report, it is said:" "" "as evidence has been applied to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi's background." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Intensifying the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go to the election box alone.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approaching from behind, you should turn around as a first, so that you can see your attacker and get out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with his knee into the bar and turn the weapon out of his hands while the attacker turns into pain. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With aggressors approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and turn it away so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and sausages of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsman on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaking each object he used a Luminometre to show himself and us what he will get in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to drain the sink of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright addressed physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his Darms by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations to flushing toilets, the task of the immune system was definitely below a sample.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was certainly justified by his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial paint showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their Luminometry was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I've done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here, because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying" "" "Let's call Ian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have ordered him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they should at least use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social apartment after a deletion of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed plainly holes, wooden planks were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and the police told the terror that the family had inflicted on, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation by residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>

<seg id="15">Neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be invoked regularly by the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogied her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing said that it would have been sowing the family with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years long.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the crowded side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant has agreed to accept all responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delusion is always the last step taken into consideration Cornwall housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have boldly responded to us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC aims to set up a disciplinary commission.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenyan athletes are threatened after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee will promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary had indicated that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 metre runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association examined the IOC for information about the case in order to exert their own investigations, a IAAF spokesman shared.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," said it in an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, the rehearsal given and signed," explained Kenyan's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich was in Beijing World Cup fourth in 2015 over 800 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days before, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed sportsmen of his country about pending doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special surveillance for a long time at the IOC after numerous doping procedures.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by IOC before the Rio Games, it was uncommon that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">In consequence, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping control conform to the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, accusations were repeatedly raised that, in Kenya, doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had hired them in the field of Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It could be proven that in this sport-type was surface-covering and systematic mutopt.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "the Parliament elections will not be held back directly at the end of the summer holidays, but the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">Because more stupid than so far, it is not: summer holidays, heat and land elections - it bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on the shores of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so do not have to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes in the end can only be labelled with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass over an election campaign just over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionality.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost invisible election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, spread roses and chat a little with the people, just as he did already his legendary word-karger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seeling has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives the blame for AfD's blossoming.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create this" "" "accelerates the rise of right-wing populists, which will presumably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its prime candidate, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if at the wrong time, one makes an election campaign at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to big demonstrations twice; Angela Merkel's administrative committee is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target audience did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely waives the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, so says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country you are forced to leave the base that it must be very strict, again to find a wire to the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the expanse of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU selector Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing: "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the opinion polls, the Social Democrats lagged at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD gained a clear victory at 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the country day." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of holiday need and largely transfer their election campaign into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "" "calls it the president of the country Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from that, green electoral champions embark on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is sanitized, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been migrated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the resort has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now proceed from Ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some significant complaints," "" "said the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlenstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many crews were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks are fraying in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limit has not been complied with, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become more quiet.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to a loss of sales in them allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road marking has thrown back its business" "" "by two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "half of his employees have to be dismissed." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, replied that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where such generosity has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all complaints Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been settled here since 1715 and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it's also very nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his stem-climbers come back after the restoration works, but Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to comment section to resow it under the pseudonym Non-Alleenue men's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed reemergence of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly stuffed, before I stand, hold my hands and tell something about something like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I came from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These vinyl records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I do not drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25 who works with Sister Ray also believes that many customers that he meets will meet the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media-pump, people who have heard about the comeback and will see to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think that it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff of a record stack flaps out." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smoother through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came in here recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on a shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who only slowly come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a low audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sexenpackter pop instead of experimental jazz groans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but psychiatric traumas are difficult to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's rather a window-bumble than a big buy-in.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so collecting disks is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearded sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm pretending to get the jeans pants pants, I watch a group of young teen girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some are so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxuries such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov agree, they leave unaccounted for at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who sticks out of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to submit 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which have a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the teardrop was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run for profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor: in various federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are tested, which are to be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used in case of accidents, where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure that there is a steady speed limit for the observance of the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement operations, and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and access bans according to time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a state-of-the-art state, one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply cluttered, it is lowered in the measurement mode, so that the wheels in the armoured and by the way also slip-proof outer shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic information in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: recently France has ordered 100 copies, after an order of 150 units last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-day Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of fijis when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medallion of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji had defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide of Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and had fun bouncing off the GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at, as if you were running in running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau grabbed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A preset sniffer from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute athlete Veremalua in the right hand corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reattachment and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou competed by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Sea sulans, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the dot on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff rang, the Fijis hugged himself and GB kicked out crammed in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in semi-finals at 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half-finalist match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown took the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinal gold than in those games, and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard pieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when they rowed the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who made such a measure.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter unfired use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental progress that make the difference and there was no one more instrumental than the coach, who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing itself is a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.</seg>

<seg id="16">There has been no downtime and there have always been new innovations because water lives and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech, she commended Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has engaged himself with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has regularly lived the water-purpose association, as if it were his own company.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing was accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good about her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who calls his lungs on a regular basis is not so fast in everyday life as quickly out of the pudding.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers tend to fall back on long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's voice and a given rhythm at the same time and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler means.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I do a long time for something, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who can hear when a tone is next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone is singing from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="4">Other surviving athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">The theme of doping continues to be the headlines at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had complained after a doping lock just before the games, became mercilessly whistled and retired at her start (100 meters chest).</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a bizarre scene: with a superimposed smile she was still stumbled into the hall and had provoked her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it was established that they won't get gold, the audience broke out into a rush storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many other sportsmen who go to the start in spite of the doping past at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m-m-relay / USA): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already locked twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell, the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex-world champion has been running even faster than before, and is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m-m-relay / Jamaika): the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit in 2010 for a six-month lock after the pain was taken by Oxycodon.</seg>
<seg id="15">She had a strong toothache after surgery, and the 29-year-old defended herself.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, world champion in 2013 and European Championship, was positively tested for the banned drug methylhexanamine from 2010 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic denied knowingly and was locked for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">The four furthest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favoritin.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-relay / USA): the Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and closed 21 months.</seg>
<seg id="20">A remedy for penis enlargement was responsible, mutated Merritt.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world for 200 and 400 m.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): probably hardly an athlete has been removed as many medals afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having been found in him testosterone doping.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 40-year-old also had to release Olympic silver 2004 due to steroid dopings and the 2006 European titles due to testosterone abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was also awarded a bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of Justice CAS.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 80,04 m he is ranked second in the world rankings.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong Kong (20 km walking, China): the world record player and Goldfavoritin was first tested in May but may still start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the 29-year-old world cup, pointers were found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement, the lock of the world anti-doping agency WADA fell mild and ran off on July 13.</seg>

<seg id="7">At about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, Hua Hin was first exploding two bombs on Thursday night in a Nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the beginning of the day two syringes went up again and another man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured at the detonation near the beach of Patong, popular with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country then another bomb exploded, which killed an urban clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive set had gone into the air in front of the precinct of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were several detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bombings bear the same signature," "" "said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday early in front of journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It was too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it was a question of the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, explained that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage limited to restricted areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days, but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely minor bombings, but most of the time they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the bombastic bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need for necessary trips to these provinces." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were carried out a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives great influence to the military in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country is heading towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost one year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop in a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest stop of the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the charges per cubic metre of waste water will amount to 2,10 euros for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (up to now 2.18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high-level calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the Landratsamt Kulmbach confirmed that Unterdecksburg was established for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal grounds, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercovers from the preceding calendar period are also to be equated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt's gravimetric increase in fees is that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewage systems with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the sewage volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses, all three plants were not least due to their age due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf sewage plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welthiahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and the first sewage pond had to be disposed of after nearly 20 years, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "to these extraordinary expenses, the continued support and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came into account." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level with the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already delimited by the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, feature-twist tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past where they were accused of using blackface conveyor or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it suggested a filter to some users this week, who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced rrism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decisively rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweeters were widespread over the photos, that the filter was" "" "hurting and least to say uncomfortable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it would be difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been moved into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling dragon.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's big audience of young people - who are diverser in terms of race diverser than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters generates an image that is offensive for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such items remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, chose to delete their Snapchat account, and called on others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that rassenrelated controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinesich-american Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence information, establishes Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as if the actual conditions were allowed on site, an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Republican Committee, intelligence committees and the military budget, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically enjoyed by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed challenges in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government officials have given orders under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it is so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in their lives after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom are underway through the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, meeting some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this trial," "" "Mr Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "harmed the morality among analysts and" "" "gave too little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention at the Centcom analyst with regard to a certain political opinion.</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector who received complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress while the investigation of the General Inspector is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts at times have divergent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the credentials on the Islamic State is reminiscent of the pressures of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a scripture about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and inevitable, a fast relay competition between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the Crossbow to the Turner to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffeshop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of dimples, could well have been under these known names, which are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he was a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney since 2000, it was perceived so sparsely the last 16 years that many people I had asked didn't know that it is an Olympic portal at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping and had had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of its never ending impact - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "rebounder" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, meaning" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Up-and-coming victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to official Olympic program according to design, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another highlight in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympic chords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel more tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumps off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympics Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Angus and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits its new fan base according to air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia violated the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dirty protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at firearms.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen fired on umpteen unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security men hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa's Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea rise; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Opio Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front des Ogaden, who have been more or less forced in recent years, will protect and rearm the turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness will explode beneath the surface after years of introspection.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they reside.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians showed that they were so hotly gathered.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Orochi and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orochi and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from ethopiens mainly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Orochi, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Orozmos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Orozmos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on a non-public illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005 after thousands were protesting against elections which, according to the reports of analysts, were apparently sealed by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of turmoil passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's guide for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal grievance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, run by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to clearly support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow campaigners who endeavor to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of explaining statements he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump insisted on the assertion on Thursday and insisted on the fact that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would not know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism leaks down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand figures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Naturally, I felt sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then to reclaim as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an etched tone, as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a major lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-to-head races in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent agents, had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps's testimony whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-banks, completely false, and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by allowing them to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and being preoccupied against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You cannot do it!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps apologies as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Waterreed soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "coes last book" "" "Chop Suey" "" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book" "" "97 Orchard" "" "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "her latest collaboration," "" "A decent meal" "", "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small liquor snack in the Flatiron District which has been in business since the IPO crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered Hackroast, this found the pair suitable for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," says Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "marks the way with which the country was dealing with it, not to be the Schlaraffenland anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense subject," "" "explains Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserolle as a "wonderful way of reusing food residue," brickman noticed that cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures have been tried as a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy common sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was not a popular additive at noon," "" "says Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "Ziegelman continues:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since then, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - assumed the eating habits of the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publicizing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housewives" and the challenge to turn pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historical tidbits." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-cake-food-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant cuisine of his kitchen, he spoke like the million-million man of the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor urged him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, was discarded once the country got back on its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">In writing the book, the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of wasting food," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average just 1.220 metres wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a plan for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "at least from a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "says Alexander Scheuerbare from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist thought long ago that Greenland sharks become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to watch, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-motion seemed to them, when they extended six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this shark nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadaver, which torches from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sharks, the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the greatest 502 inches measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lenticular heart.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, their birth should lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons inert large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-hai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haie with the reproduction obviously have at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose neck at the neck a 120 year old harpoon top was stuck, was captured in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparse flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal is losing heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "so a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionist biologist Scheuerbare." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on the way to a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were overcome.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the registrants in the foreseeable two years, the Oberministrante round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Several pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to become the Episcopal town of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered to the open portal of the mercy of Freiburg Münster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and holy rooms, arose in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage and told the Pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Minster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual daytrips were framed in the morning and evening, each with a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis made raxes at field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parishes of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a delicious as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued through Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, one took the stage to St. Peter, which was the exhausting stretch of road, but had to take some 500 metres of altitude in the course of high school and then to be heard again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Minis was visibly relieved and happy in the later afternoon at Freiburg's Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis arrived at the evening mass in Münster were greeted by the Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the metropolitan metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner rasts last night in the men's team Sprint in the velodrome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the Jump and made the legend proud when he came home to visit a victory from the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in London despite the Hoys regression in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who were victorious four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner prevailed in the qualification round an Olympic chord, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders prevailed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hinder was just behind, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, moving in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked out from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up an Olympic chord in the final round and the World Champion is defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph on the Kennys and Hoys page, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped off on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later retracted this statement and there was no objection to England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such a problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23rd March (apparently sacred date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next to the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had argued with officials prior to the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama in the background played out in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and mobbbling, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its climax for the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium molten from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers "workplaces - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus cancels all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidised for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three further owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL believes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore AGL believes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual subscription of $187 million in "anticipation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "do not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a declaration of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before possible closure of the Portland melt plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity every year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, and the fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché-hairy action of almost every birthday septic of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to take part in this publicity for her other girls.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, surely a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls's big sister Kim likes her what the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference which is more similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue pulls a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the bearing 615 pages advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of its cover stars is expected so eagerly that in the last two years, the magazine has yet to seep pictures of the magazine before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years, there were clearly more" "" "celebrities who like" "" "as models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she finds herself in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything is based on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the Mistress of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings revived again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to reach the point of disgrace seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>

<seg id="1">England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we used a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions were benefiting from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will have 10,000 new apprentices alone, 40,000 new jobs will create and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will end.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlarging Heathrows is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion, and a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blockade are the same as a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it told users that users could update their filters in the program to reblock advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday Facebook announced that its Desktopside would modify the coding regarding its adverts to make it more difficult to detect, which part of the page advertising is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin and Her battle between the appearing open source community and the hangers has been in progress since the invention of scorers," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered into the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying displays for the industry have become.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, some 200 million people worldwide use display lockers; almost four times so much 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebooks.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly rotated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daytime in the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously thought by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it once was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to excess heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When its hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in what connection the rotation periods with planetary origin are standing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">You are now turning to the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates these mature stars encounter large amounts of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aged, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">A learned athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the pre-operations of more than 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the opening of the B-trial and a hearing has been applied.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously" "" "and demands full cooperation in the investigations," "" "quoted Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio, the news of the positive rehearsal at Danekova was leaking, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "declared the athletes." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said that the banned substance will be the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-Probe should also be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately reported criticism to the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, for example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping-laden nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of athletes, especially the Danekova case is another severe blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world federation had forbidden the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, even the Kenya Läufernation produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sport, in addition, the earlier departures in China caused fierce disputes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle, I want to surrender," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of a debate with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been positively tested for the stimulus trimetazide in the Chinese nationals in 2014 but had to sit down just a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Blackmail programmers are currently targeted at companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the ransom fees demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to send ransom is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently observing a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes head Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an victim, it searches specifically for recently changed files such as word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies rely on sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage goes out when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported loss of sales due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany already several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always tell the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the use areas and contact with blackmail users and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free-to-access support websites or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros, businesses have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, says safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have been created by the malware themselves, providing advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price range between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail coaches then look for further hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and mandates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then supervise spammer with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators instead threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes head Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">In this way, the potential of damage, depending on the type of data, is still a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "in the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hackerkonferenz decon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such blockaded heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V only has a small impact of only 1.60 m, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, but only the cockpit-top is falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a trunk of 453 l at high up and 1026 l at reversed back rests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk is well loaded, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V extremely powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to perform a bit more quietly to his work.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency brake assist (works by speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane maintenance assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart speed control reacts to the traffic sign detection and throttle the speed when required.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touch screen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and can therefore be easily reached.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are alright.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "it stole regularly on the" "" "Umgehungsstraße" "" "- here a picture of November." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">But this shall change: the legal proceedings shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the traffic jam when driving across the motorway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleeping any more in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what one understands is the insomnia, that is, an one- and sleeping-disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the sleeping feel many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board in the German physician association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in a depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pondering about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who are not sleeping well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, guesses guesses.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily symptoms such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there is hardly any hospital in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, when dealing with sleeping problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises Weber.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to investigate in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise doctors, for example, in snoring with respiratory failure, in case of illness, for sleep converters or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, "Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make noonday sleep," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the sticking, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Apart from the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws on the sleeping end at the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">The shot counts on: regular sleeping and standing periods, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between, still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga Road in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't work like that, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior broadcaster Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself in favour of a hard action by the police against the project, called the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After evacuating the premises on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrol official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the time of its renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house owners, the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers pulled away from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, is genervt above all from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "it does not sound like a" "" "Kiez" "", "who wished for a majority of police protection against vandaliatory left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior designer and the police make between house-occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which in comparison to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the part of the city has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and scribbles from all over the world over the past few years: now residents from GDR times and former home occupiers share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on raised slices or freshly painted facades, which have been tossed with coloured bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "leftist violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes make damages which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is most important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rīga Street - and remains.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her that the locals get back to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the Deutungshoheit about the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "indeed, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well cared for," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drains who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who travel should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub district, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle is the Refugee Commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group for refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying lust for wool, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant that some - less ridiculing than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in social work, just an affluent Wollmksau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has fixed a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and minor problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be carried by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Department of Agriculture to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not have private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it doesn't work to rely on private dwellings, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community apartments must be tested as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fixed or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine client reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus also here administration and honorary content jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it will take and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problems, says customer honest, "people with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the latest happenings fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says quite clearly," "" "What some naive might call." "" "a residual risk could and would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would call them completely in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes clear that the Urbach is already busy to integrate the previous people reasonably.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
