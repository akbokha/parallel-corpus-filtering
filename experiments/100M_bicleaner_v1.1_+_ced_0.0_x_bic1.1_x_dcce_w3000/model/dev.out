Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as on Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and repro@@ aches Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal signed by Obama for the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , on the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech against Obama , which was partly regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor conf@@ essed to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ ble on a white block : &quot; I am sorry I wanted to und@@ ress it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he had shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , forcing students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is doing .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ l died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the social sciences and history department whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the gradu@@ ation that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee of an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ time friend@@ ships ll@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends were left and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica qu@@ ill before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were sitting in the rooms and j@@ ol@@ ly together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , ran the first semester seminar program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English @-@ professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his fr@@ at@@ ernity and student committee .
on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , about 900 people attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vi@@ gil , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss known as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it would cover 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5.000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the head@@ count rises from October to December .
while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip the shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated crow@@ ning and an arm &apos;s length from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the conflict lasting almost five years , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief calls once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution .
ban said to a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey figures showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it has ( yet ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ey &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and start letting their dollar flow to t@@ opp@@ le it .
here are some recent survey figures indicating that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s arbit@@ ration values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages approximately the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see tru@@ mp temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely criti@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters believe that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , as ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their schol@@ ar hats , republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four of ten said that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the final cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will see Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ ap@@ ed the majority support .
he has ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have made their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have firm their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to move to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their mind are twice as common to Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp was accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a turning point in public discourse on 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey from Monday 6 of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son account for around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans were frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ art road is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
one square meter of a roof@@ top building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros in the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places of residence , however , one of the prices comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ el has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally close to the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start with mil@@ ler and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ schüt@@ z in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy match by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern for a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus a dream start into the Milan Mission .
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double @-@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ ens ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ success in Serie should be the first step towards the finale on May 28th , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received the Champions League for the Bayern leadership during his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bayern leadership Roberto , who made a shi@@ pper of the World Champion covered as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based spoken word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated presentation without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the premi@@ er league , including rep@@ utable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offen@@ sives efforts .
the attacks were often triggered by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand side Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortunate from the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as an Olympic hero , Ide@@ ye Brown defeated the Pol@@ es &apos; head@@ ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved up their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could set needle sticks .
at Tor@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was forgiveness .
so , for instance , when he directed a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New , Guardi@@ ola left a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng defending it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back in the ca@@ vern after muscular problems , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of some war@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience block evi@@ dently had prov@@ oked the supporters of Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went on strike against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : with ren@@ unciation , the risk falls quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth at an early age .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Nutrition Research Institute ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ barrel .
the scientists had observed over 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ val inflammation in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the haz@@ ards fell back to the level of non @-@ smokers , Thomas Dietrich von der England University explained to Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , declared study director H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and containers and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health until high age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth loss affects the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of late Anti@@ quity
archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the municipal district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department for archaeological ground preservation .
in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found .
Trier was already known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
after a young woman was moved to the train station in the direction of Gei@@ sel@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the people for help .
on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railroad station towards the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
by the acquisition of the train , she has carried serious injuries from the Federal Police .
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by a rescue team .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman , the investig@@ ative officials are not aware of any findings .
the incident might have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
to shar@@ pen the dispute on the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its mode of operation corresponds to much more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP should create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US will jointly determine independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
until now , the parties involved agreed among each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court .
there could then also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the Investor @-@ State Disp@@ ute Sett@@ lements ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , on which companies are forced to off@@ end damages of tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it was critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economy Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform that Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart that the shy act@@ ress recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captiv@@ ated by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he re@@ counts on the basis of various places he shows again and again on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs , which blend harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 U.S. states should follow in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has appeared and has positively broken up certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
they live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York will return to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece is published in 2005 .
bor@@ dering ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic selling pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still orchest@@ rated wide , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs have long ceased , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on end bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is currently touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests sit in their chairs , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without judging a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate basically &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; Q has been eag@@ erly awaited with tension since his election
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; D Group and will be working with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commemor@@ ative ceremony celebrating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow mini@@ atures have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation on wins .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes take place in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister , said that the party &quot; very clear &quot; is that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has since been T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different politi@@ c , says that he has ideas for questions addressed to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ tur@@ als are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; striking &quot; and the stri@@ fe with re@@ perc@@ ussions , and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the shadows of economic ministers in him , if he doesn &apos;t participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch P@@ unch , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ tures . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the frac@@ ture with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und rises through accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und rose according to data , which showed an increase in the UK wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller bid target .
between May and July , the result of excluding Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and quick@@ est estimate since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the Po@@ und rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index increased by 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars by a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put Sach@@ s his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased 3.@@ 1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet J@@ D Sports &apos;s expansion plans , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Justi@@ n Bie@@ ber in the capital : on a Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Justi@@ n Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blasph@@ em@@ ous 21 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young , a tra@@ verse with over@@ chic face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million Euros heavy .
rather even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns .
how Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name R@@ itz Carl@@ ton .
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Justi@@ n yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you see i@@ dol , whose posters are attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite , where Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a should sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to take care of someone ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also , Bie@@ ber does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the Super Satellite promotion he collected three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company washed many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ ks .
if Justi@@ n Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the wind@@ ow@@ pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to place 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato @-@ pat@@ ron@@ ing idea
potatoes or Mon@@ ks ?
both - and indeed in the potato cor@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sp@@ ills in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lebanese has now registered the idea at the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility patent according to the authority of the authority .
therefore Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much flesh and how much potatoes the sp@@ ears contain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - decline
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A stores from an Al@@ di uprising in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a grass@@ land campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and stores shop@@ keepers who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler performs its annual investment strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment .
there is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailer sales .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generates sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on a high fixed cost basis Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retailers , which supply 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt in terms of turnover and margins at the same time .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize sale prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores through fast growing fresh foods and to provide a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging remedi@@ ation programs will go to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise from the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious disman@@ tling of C@@ yrene with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated two times by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison cried out : &quot; W@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat the car , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp ver@@ ook a potential US Open Vic@@ tory from Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty busy about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost due to a pit@@ cher in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too rigor@@ ously .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the changing area , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick made a very quick reference to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained everyone who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a man &apos;s land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ iled insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were expelled from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place over the next few days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would have been made that the EU states would record more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special Summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not set its hopes for a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency meeting held on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison occup@@ ants were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entry point to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most emerging economies are looking for a better life and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia for a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve of the military use of the military which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others had already entered the country .
they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws .
authorities are busy re@@ pairing the fence .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire had arrived to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to penetrate there .
about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage over Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced whether he is candidates for the pres@@ idency receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates they will support .
but Clinton supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders generated some profits .
Clinton has a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters less than 50 years has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit advance on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s suppor@@ ter also men@@ tions her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a quot@@ a for dealing with problems and elec@@ tr@@ at@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice president casts a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked to vote who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den has decided not to can@@ di@@ ze for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , out of 20 points with bi@@ des in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ tr@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some key features in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den view maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den follows the three candidates best in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
in general , democratic voters of the elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic constitu@@ ents have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being placed during office as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic vot@@ ees of the elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not imp@@ acted their opinions in all .
but it is another story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinions have worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled to vote nationwide see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , maintain good leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democr@@ at voters is 6 percentage points .

Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tru@@ mp in the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is om@@ itted , and others lose their grip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired from 6 % to 23 % over the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , has been kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio take up 6 % of the third place .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - it ends at 19 % support with the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the most recent pol@@ l from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after having ap@@ olog@@ ised for him to question tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during an I@@ owa campaign .
pleasant hot temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea during this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) communic@@ ates with .
in contrast , hot temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes to up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , for a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ lagen was lod@@ ged against five people .
members of Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police with .
officials said he had been loaded with tied eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headache , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g had been impot@@ ent and supposedly waiting an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contacting Andy Men@@ g , the national pres@@ idents of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the bro@@ therhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sign@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has been added repeatedly with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood . at least one student has died on the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended prosecution for the first five members for murder of the third rank .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ous attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to be responsible only for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest is coming , and the domestic demand is falling , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so severely stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal tre@@ ble , but still at a low level to cause a sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some sectors of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets income 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might once again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study of what happened after the F@@ ed interest rate increases .
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , Head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases they often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a net interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this is different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants raised the F@@ ed interest rate all year round , and all eyes focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ eding heights have been put into shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market cap@@ tures interest rates , and the pattern is pretty much the same as in the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are quicker than in shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , ren@@ ders seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the investors return immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , loan spann@@ ing has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond very positively three months after initial interest rates , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers .
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Investig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Investig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts in different opinions are how quickly that will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading MP and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private traveler does not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham &apos;s conservative MEP , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly not to be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; stupid &quot; the word - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC CEO dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn anything else about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er efforts must be made to engage the audience when it did so in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals onto the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins interven@@ ed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed because it &apos;s not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in a special BBC way .
he added that he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our own stall &quot; when the next time we start a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to issue money to the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose by slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
experts say there is now evidence that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales channel the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases using their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that sett@@ les , and we may possibly experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times saw the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products , such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in downtown cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ ma .
mo@@ urn crowded , mostly dressed in white , the route to pay their respect , when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king imposed a san@@ ction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the corp@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm than he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was banned overseas .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which r@@ ushed into a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month .
the bin Laden group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ abled the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s grandfather as part of the massive construction project , which is managed by the bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the sovereign family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son , who was dispos@@ s@@ essed by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that Br@@ its lay down its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European cra@@ ft@@ men who carry out work in their homes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are skill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the build @-@ up chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now out@@ dated .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that address tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , as eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are made by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to move this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group ow@@ es the cost of closing the shut@@ ters .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , who owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and indul@@ gence .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of minist@@ erial abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this repro@@ ach in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the accused were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 .
he deduc@@ es the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ person of the Sho@@ op@@ ener Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted that at no time an asset was created to the association .
the sports officials had paid only expense allowance and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the pas@@ siv@@ ity amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we continue or ban the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ winners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand @-@ Emplo@@ yer of the Financial Office &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made money , our life insurance policies are laid down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association , it has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it can only be done without debt .
in case of appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively to 1991 .
therefore one has paid off part of the expense reimbur@@ s@@ ements only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , package and not detailed bookings appeared , the former Chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us administered the two defend@@ ants together , the second defend@@ ant said .
why the out@@ casts had not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial reinforcement , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account against the one of the function@@ aries investigating the abuse of office .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his testimony , was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time .
then he finally thought that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never related a cent salary , he only calculated o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting .
he added some diets to the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to present accurate records for the early years .
these were no longer kept for an operational test , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant was also entitled to kilomet@@ ric benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the shifts are done in cash , and from his place of residence he has to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main hearing will be continued on 23 September by questioning witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard puts more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff breakdown that has been running for three years , the Compu@@ Lo@@ ad will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the sub@@ missions at the U.S. Compu@@ graphic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the 5@@ 5.000 jobs that have been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Share declined by 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , which has grown with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business will still be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .

sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
this resulted in revenue in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets rather than traditional computers and getting more and more shops online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans include a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would most likely be rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated : 54 per cent were talking about it , 35 percent agreed to agree .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in cooperation with the Syrian governor Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed said they would be 20 percent .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has deployed several hundred refugees at the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water thro@@ wer .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind that , a police line had formed and a water designer stood behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little bit .
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokes@@ men also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half of the opinion that the F@@ ed would do so now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will last .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and starts a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior associate at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less harsh outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the indications point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision shall be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death penalty at the Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; officials announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller on his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb sailed 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly had a relationship with Schmidt , officials said on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said .
the police said that Lamb was inv@@ oked at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University , as his W@@ roc@@ law gives on the University &apos;s website .

in 2001 he fought for leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ time partner Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett for cancer .
the actor allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the approximately 1000 managers around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and is evaluating the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no longer any board for the passenger &apos;s business with Lufthansa in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with its new positioning , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the airline airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed following the court @-@ pending strike on this Thursday .
that shared the union with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come to sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict between union and airline led to several strikes in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilot , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa Cargo is leaving the Euro@@ wings group @-@ owned low @-@ cost line .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this resulted in crying the left outside defender and excluding him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w entered the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bass score and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be escaped a Red Card and the hanging of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

the UK def@@ enders have an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you heard that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very ill with it . I am so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ abel of Dr. Se@@ uss , appeared in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , re@@ produces an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , li@@ stens in spite of the protests of the nam@@ ing lor@@ ry , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , puff@@ ing creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax twenty times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral department .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron &apos;s staff but gave no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude an exit victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th ex@@ its from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
choosing Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I told this - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first sat down in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drum man I highly estimate .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and received four qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s bucket of cri@@ cket player .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred ranks right away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there are no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are in tune with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team representatives do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could gain access if the economy gets into a dol@@ drums by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is fierce because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at recently said that some member states are so deeply mired in different crises such as the EU is now and not always fed up by its own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if they thre@@ aten social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not go alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
German cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ run like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a fade @-@ in force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain is a lef@@ tist one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers might even deliberately not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s reference campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press crown , as they did during the 1975 refer@@ endu@@ ms inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can weak@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who made a name for himself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , telephone hack@@ ers , and the pseudo @-@ foreigners who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but found out that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Mr Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle about the un@@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need more time for me - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ ties , an error back then and today .
it can take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the sc@@ out in him fought to not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70@@ ies when his old father on TV tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
but fighting to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ie &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and MPs on Monday evening after all reports .
whatever the sha@@ ky bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n tries to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a nest of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the reference campaign for a matter of course such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is sure that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the power of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze public health report on E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic public health principle is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who have been sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting have been summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ essed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; served &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to have the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease associated with smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ a , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ bourne and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for placing public @-@ law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Communications Committee in the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I think medium or long term is not a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are funded , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ bourne is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ production .
to be honest , other channels would give her right arm .
I &apos;m trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ ern@@ a should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue when they go on their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the radio station , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of us think we &apos;re all thinking that one gets a lot of money for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday demanded that the BBC should check their her@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that little from BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain &quot; the public broad@@ caster in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels to make alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on motor neur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the di@@ aphrag@@ ms of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultras@@ onic to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of light .
but Chal@@ de@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the required position in the brain on optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the cheerful voice and carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons leave no doubt that this announcement for the world &apos;s largest weapons fair is a milit@@ ant par@@ o@@ dy produced by Am@@ nesty International to ramp up the willingness of the British government to bring weapons to repres@@ sive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jam@@ bor@@ ee at the Ex@@ Ce@@ L Centre in London &apos;s Do@@ ck@@ lands .
related : D@@ SE@@ I We@@ ap@@ ons Fair : author@@ itarian regimes flow to London
but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second view .
&quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from 15 to 18 September . &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the characters of London Underground and the hall@@ marks of the DL@@ R line which turns into the image of a tank .
in September , a flock of tru@@ ste@@ es will drive with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help stop the arm@@ isti@@ ce .
the 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work in the museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective named Special Pat@@ rol Group helped distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys claimed to &quot; gain access to around one third of the bus shel@@ ters on the planet . &quot;

after Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and attempt to bring political work to the public outside galleries .
many artists deal with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside to the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapon posters gre@@ ets commuters in the subway .
the am@@ nesty @-@ video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP which works as a non @-@ profit organization with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the Ce@@ L - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the ring with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a stepping out of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arm@@ isti@@ ce comes from the field inside Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors showcase fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I &apos;ve been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the move into student residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely horri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell you where you come from , if and where you have taken the sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love or hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
people often turn into drinks @-@ recep@@ tions , movie night venues and local hits , but they are also the places where people dress up and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship with the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted persons receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send it a text message instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my student residence halls had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship by baking .
since you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I put you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , it depends on whether you &apos;re a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to face dor@@ man@@ t when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ s@@ works .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbors , whether it makes them mind , drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it &apos;s three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded to this with even lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would be random@@ ly moved into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be so aw@@ k@@ ward embarrass@@ ing when you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage , ran@@ som it , dis@@ connect and then see it every day and perhaps witness how it treats all shared friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his not closed room , the border between an Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety by hiding - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will put in the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack off your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators ,
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the only educ@@ ative mother and the servant @-@ servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build favorable and well @-@ suited today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass storage in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great deal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a row of terra@@ ced houses needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of residence .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily converted to the individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do building regulations have complicated their plans ?
guil@@ d : I have legally qualified my project .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the position ordin@@ ance .
Gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still subject to who creates three apartments in a row of terra@@ ced houses , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no shortage of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ ds : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely doesn &apos;t work .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the servant @-@ servant .
I show how one can build still today still cheap and well .
that &apos;s what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean the dele@@ tion of apps to make room - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , because the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to a break@@ out of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate play@@ - and tennis player , who held in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .

there@@ with it is possible to record chess players , who cannot raise the membership fee .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the senior centre for the elderly have gathered themselves under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new start @-@ up point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the hill into the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office has recently been opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and advice on issues such as nursing insurance or services of health and nursing insurance .
for years we have established with our out@@ patient care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in@@ frequently many services of the insurance companies are not used , because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new hous@@ eholder Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ itary and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , it is possible to use additional services such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis perfectly complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both executives especially in demographic change .
this is because it makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ bure@@ au also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular social sharing . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus informed on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the artist &apos;s house left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as stated in the shipment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology in Vienna during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect , but has also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design from 1972 to 1983 .

fine : Tim Wiese tos@@ ses polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese has been noticed in Bremen .
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter was engaged in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , 30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have added over the past two years .
intellectu@@ ally , however , he has not admitted .
Wiese had just cut the ha@@ irs in the centre of Bremen when he saw outside a parking space guar@@ dian put out a bal@@ lot for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
meadow then r@@ ushed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the police and threw it down to the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
in the city of Bremen one confirms the alle@@ gations that the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the examination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I decided whether meadow will be shown , or not .

men spray on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
and one of these men cried out to the young man , and struck him with his fist into the face .
the victim suffered a nos@@ eb@@ and @-@ burst and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dismissed the victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
using a hammer mechanism , one applied on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
up to now , only a vag@@ ue work description is available .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Minister of Economic Development U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : on October 1st Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be at the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12th October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ low@@ ships met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her medical training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and also wants to get into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees himself being his own boss .
and so one agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a general practitioner in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and was honorary member of the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ien is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a family doctor .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros is given by the land@@ owners as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of rock breaks , in the north German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another dentist practice .
a positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enst@@ auses .
if no successor had been found , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours , inci@@ dentally also looks above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their departure ending in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen re@@ members sm@@ iles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y she already feels after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will surely see many patients again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds , laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pressed myself before gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum claim can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ granted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is how the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants not to stone its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government told , the first refugees had already tried to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving .
it is primarily a matter of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days , his country counts with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , agreed on Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was , that people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day additional buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were travelling through Serbia all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard Hungary made it , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkans @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west course .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non @-@ Schengen member , has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently confirmed a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local note in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently be about very high refugee numbers .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having gained an insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
the captured information has been reported to have made insi@@ der trading on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce in Mannheim has existed for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is frequent operation .
people perform their err@@ ands , sometimes fast cad@@ a@@ vers , partly cozy .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ alon at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
city railways stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ un@@ ing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four big tables each with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce help drew attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce help is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks such as the volunteer workers .
while some pass spontaneously to the chal@@ k and set the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again small discussions about the action itself are developing , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband wear@@ er of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public activity is good for the twenty @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people .
an estim@@ ation that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking volunteers by calling volunteers , she immediately reported and was part of the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ th@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the victims and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point , consider it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result Mi@@ xed , Financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex is reporting dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the price increases , the reduced view will come to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on January 4 and despite higher charges for bo@@ d@@ freight from heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase in comparison with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will yield &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which resulted in sales in its unit Express Shi@@ pment for St@@ ag@@ ni@@ zation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , bo@@ d@@ traffic increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher operating costs in the freight business .
in pre@@ market trading , about an hour before opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States lo@@ oming over them at the end of the adorned , two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the nation &apos;s economic interests before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy &apos;s data show that it is solid , the most recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets might make the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and is also only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they can observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to keep waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect a F@@ ed wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mitig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average ranked 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good path to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow exac@@ erb@@ ation of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary to increase the sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world were coming together at the end of the last month , after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , while the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the May high .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence affects the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have failed in the past few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should be technically not included in its decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Cur@@ ren@@ cy Authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke at that time in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; nar@@ rowed their monetary expansion &quot; triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that seem not to be associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , right @-@ wing member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to raising interest rates , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives removed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Sav@@ ings of the Bank of England .
the most recent turbul@@ ence does not come near that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest rate because the markets upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive this day in Germany .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also at Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 songs .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2,3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited gymn@@ asi@@ um at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ platz are progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions .
prior to this , the committee had decided among other things an application for a civil @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permit for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ insulated first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was again the roof @-@ tilt , which for energetic reasons - different from the development plan - should be under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan for roof@@ ing does not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Bern@@ rie@@ der Council generally rather restric@@ ts with liber@@ ating employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the turn of the gymn@@ asi@@ um , however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
sur@@ pl@@ uses are expected from school and mass transportation .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will be submitted to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) for inspection .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is reflected by the start@@ ling plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and conven@@ es on Wednesday , September 23 .
if plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
for the next two years , fishermen with their team , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves of the agreement , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
in future , Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the Federal District Court , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ ably &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; received by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has not been a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the doctor &apos;s director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hunting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au &quot; &quot; &quot;
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police told .
after a shooting , a 63 and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was initially unclear .
the criminal police as@@ cer@@ tained .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their corp@@ ses were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ h@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ h@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the prosec@@ utor and the police r@@ ushed on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday night , who had indeed indicated the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she did not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ h@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tances , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ h@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities reported that the police inter@@ ro@@ gated the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the corp@@ se in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead weight on him .
the further investigation is intended to shed light on the closer circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing short@@ ages
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable shel@@ ters .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &apos;s association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as an asylum seek@@ er in an initial accommodation .
many come into the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable savings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is pushing a flat deficit which grows from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are already approximately 77@@ ,000 units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals lived in large cities to live in WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the sl@@ um@@ ps on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing bau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should stimulate the social housing construction again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be wai@@ ved for the under@@ purchase tax and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments will be suspended for a limited period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are needed according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee housing from the German State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros were rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia are setting up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary there is practically no coming through , as more and more refugees choose their way across Croatia .
Zagreb announces the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
the route , however , is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Slov@@ ene Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also making decent asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees from Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to media reports , most came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and with taxis .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
the border strip has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 affected people .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws ass@@ ures the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years and expul@@ sion from the country are threatened by the defend@@ ants .
according to the Immig@@ ration Service , there were 94 asylum applications laid out in the new &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two older people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stopped there .
but practically nobody has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers started to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side during the past few weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the recording centers in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants remained in the country according to government information .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instructions of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were occupied with the clearing up when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the near Passa@@ u .
before that , we had the un@@ hoped @-@ out guests only once again , with snack and drink .
we said the same thing , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
one man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE train to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els after the announcement that the rail traffic was stopped in Germany , but still to try to cross the border .
however , the regional train was stopped at the river Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high on the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with Bavarian neighbors on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday before a Zwei@@ brücken run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent tens of thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of being in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ lowed land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter , to make decent conditions for people looking for protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 3@@ 5.000 winter@@ proof districts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has all the hands full to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place districts for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first reception centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Con@@ rad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ el@@ essness in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shelter of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big hu@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; championship power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad calcul@@ ates with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ry year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the federal states , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a drum without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these would have assured him of creating quot@@ as for the coming refugees too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , with the intention of clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations on the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels which stand empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for housing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that lod@@ gings have to respect a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the wa@@ iter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he founded Con@@ rad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t speak un@@ truth without further in the face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier have no expense in the Republic as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the search for neighbour@@ hoods has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected can currently be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , further sites should be checked for suitability for emer@@ gen@@ cies .
the head of the city council is critici@@ zing the division of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts also have to contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has de@@ activated the further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the further departure of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the prot@@ ectors would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , the fact that Austria now also carries out controls on its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the German action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group , S &amp; T , is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T head Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft and later on which to acquire .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metre rest area in the building has already been rented , for another 40 percent there will be requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to post@@ p@@ one this project in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ aden : after all , she has now grown up in the form of another business loc@@ ale .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in Greater Linz selling this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has gotten Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
for me most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in tran@@ ce , the professional lady cannot answer with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ sett@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he speaks hostile to himself , concerns journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US pres@@ idency stir@@ s up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and it cuts well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ eh@@ fr@@ is@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village is related to it over -@@ zig @-@ corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous s@@ ap@@ lings , to which along with Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , I tend to say that Tru@@ mp is a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ eh@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the initi@@ ator , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Tru@@ mp arrives from the village of the An@@ ders .
the success story of Tru@@ mp started in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the USA for gold dig@@ gers .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a movie start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was born in Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans rather distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp sometimes comes ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension host@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family during a visit ended up something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership during the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s app@@ rais@@ als .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the German capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the Moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this disadvantage of the down@@ side seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August , Today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 ran .
until now , Sun@@ rise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers has risen to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck lightly The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe resulted in an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia attracted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine feel confident that the Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ flow the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before being checked out of three , you may acci@@ dentally have given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the finale on Thursday
all three women have om@@ itted in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you who was to get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed S@@ ams &apos;s energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought it was all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally tuned to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed to Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open day training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and Hay@@ den gave Hay@@ den the next opportunity to return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ nes publicly at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ er Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his fel@@ lows catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the playground after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens , you just care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ den compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut back then in 2007 , when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the free voters demand the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of high refugee numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ es stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get ratings in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Friday survey of the Free Ele@@ ctions conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the c@@ law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Independent Elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need united federal standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy in large @-@ scale cities should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing tradition remains on the agenda : the policy of education .
for the new school year , Cultural Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 high schools in which an extension of the upper secondary school of three to four years is being tested .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums they want .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect the markets to be replaced until after the compo@@ unding decision in the US and also for the big decline on the stock markets this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after police rub@@ bing rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ alo@@ i District , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less mort@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of T@@ arus , who want to have their own country .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflict since the age of 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 sq@@ .@@ m. area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete proposals yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4,000 square metre plot in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
the plan is to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , just a few months ago and the building that is on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
numerous An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the res@@ elling of their leisure activities
months ago was negotiated behind closed doors , mo@@ cked , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs right now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
intense reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cla@@ d that overlooks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like many other project critics that traffic would increase tremend@@ ously because of the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on a hect@@ are large area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts bi@@ dding campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a bi@@ dding campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to publi@@ ci@@ zing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : physicians With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children , and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / em@@ el@@ ief to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya rav@@ aged by the war .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min strain @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach cr@@ ush - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved completely and at 28 % partly .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved by only one percent compared to diabetes , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , A@@ 1@@ c &apos;s average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ erec@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater recovery in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ sight of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was obes@@ e people who had undergone an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show any advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ ing is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly seen in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the love story , the novel is most likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama thank@@ ed Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions like real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US led to a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , swal@@ lowing strong alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years which report toxic control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are more and more coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can visi@@ bly drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
watch videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents reported to have mixed dis@@ infection agents with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four spra@@ yers from straw@@ berry du@@ ften@@ dem suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally regarded as drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ings Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah cl@@ ung her words and wasn &apos;t able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had thrust his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez advised parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ infection agents containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities assume that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; labor@@ ers &quot; by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; she reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to the disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
at a rear @-@ end collision between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ tha , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was injured in a rear @-@ end accident .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the roundabout in the direction of the roundabout and realised too late that two vehicles ahead of the roundabout had stopped at the roundabout .
as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck and pushed this car to a standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
damage to the accident involving accidents of some 10,000 euros was caused by the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer driving and had to be tow@@ ed .

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show any highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they speak of the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that he has to fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the ensu@@ ing departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has a five @-@ point lead , is clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
war@@ bur@@ ton careful in January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago indicating that he made some January transfers , R@@ angers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new acc@@ esses and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer season have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ target person Mich@@ u with draw@@ back card
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires with the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a nasty kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set for S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defender was later cancelled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity questioned , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer and added , &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t go back to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tann@@ en@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the Board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but confess that the decline has to end on the field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back on tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points out of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team who won everything , in cups or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while overall unemployment is rising in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the U@@ K@@ s , as showed the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number higher than the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
later today , except in late legal action , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death Chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and because there are often more applications available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Cloud &apos;s close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying unnecessary death .
man after a wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he was talking to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to app@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale police called on Tuesday to a domestic peace break in pool ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt sni@@ ff@@ ing at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back for 18 months because of es@@ pion@@ age charges and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like excessive grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about this head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his st@@ ables .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a fraud .
if this is the case , they should certainly seize on their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to believe that it will become personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought about it .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations levels have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he said he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ disputed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ et@@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s legs , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the day the whole day , which was also the case .
but it also had it on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with pack on race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost disgu@@ ised remark to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ad of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team felt confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it shows up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson talking about ring fights when she beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think about us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co vs. Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the pre @-@ fin@@ als in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who might suffer a life @-@ long penalty for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ threatening penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was app@@ reh@@ ensive about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the penalty , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ ection@@ ate declarations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit under the conditions of giving his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reporting to the police every day and holding an outlet from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday night .
two of the three trucks took place in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police told them .
the driver &apos;s cab of crash culp@@ ture rup@@ tures completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ erts her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then alleged that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ lia on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching for a computer was done by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and thus confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges of having inc@@ ess@@ ant pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the requirements on 25 January of this year and did not appear in court at a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked H@@ og@@ g to not appear in the act of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October in order to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in custody pending hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
it was still included before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up away from the large control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left the people at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest
out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts .
they had reached the German side by foot and bridges .
there , they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registration .
at the Munich central station , according to Federal Police reports , there were again significantly more refugees compared to the week &apos;s start on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the capital city alone until 8.@@ 00 a.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : drop@@ out of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm o@@ aks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure region over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; who had been pulled over the Atlantic in the last days from the Bermuda Islands .
storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D it is still to be expected until Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the Lake Constance with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 km / h .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the crowd is doing it : every two years , the autom@@ akers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is mainly on the compact car that is currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of the Federal Ministry of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
a lot of new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
Opel presents a new entry under the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are also included for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be connected to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trade , it comes the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in the segment .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer , however , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand on the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the un@@ folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel justice institution , who was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his official position on the grounds of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Federal State of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the verdict of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and rejected the case for re @-@ examination there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons from the question@@ able period only a few days of confin@@ ement were decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear the privacy of the personality would be concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of compensation .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war in the past .
so they did not speak to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
a Dec@@ ision of 2011 is also un@@ worthy of a decision of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a prisoner in a parallel incident in November 2009 .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been hit head@@ lines because of lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even fights occur because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of offspring , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year , approximately 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to accept a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s going on in Germany gives the following overview .
according to various forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are needed annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has ever been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
but the lack of housing is dramatic , especially in affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing comes out of the rental price , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double its funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing a year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest € 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Buil@@ ders agree that there must also be more tax benefits for housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institut für Arbeitsmarkt@@ - und Berufs@@ forschung ) , it is estimated that 55 % of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find a job in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Col@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : from the prohibition of working for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on labour for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as does the residence obligation that limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the view is generally accepted that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
up to now there is not yet a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the Königs@@ weg for work integration , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the par@@ ental parents , it is first of all very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ omon , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without any knowledge of the German will be prepared for education in the welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ ate St@@ offers says about the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
refugees who are willing to accept refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any services according to the asylum application law more if they start a study .
the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ af@@ e , since they do not fall under the circle of legitimate persons .
tolerated refugees have had to live in Germany for four years so far to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , this gap shor@@ tens to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
but this gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important component of their identity .
the state should gradually acquire the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic char@@ itable association is also important , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and give him some control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
those who wanted to su@@ ck such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general equality law for a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series showed , in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention Germany commit must become reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees , says Medical Foreign Minister Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we are creating that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needs to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals at the same time when registering health cards .
services provided could later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , doctors make especially the language barriers to be created .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients .
interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over not only in clinics , also in medical practices .
however , many refugees would have helped with more general medical start @-@ ups in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee women , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with the partly different clinical pictures , German doctors make sure that their education is clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the don@@ or , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich M@@ Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social welfare offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of intrigu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on a brick or v@@ ase .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
so the gift for lovers lies in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world @-@ city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst as his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to absorb loos@@ ely .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous Sal@@ mon Sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and dex@@ ter@@ ity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
sn@@ ak@@ y people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities in cir@@ c@@ uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are very often subject to various animal welfare organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read by the eyes according to possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena too .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or one hundred viewers , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites from September 17 to 20 daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. to its performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the show at 5 pm the prices are dis@@ counted .
in addition , the animals are open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell from a podium at the beginning of the year down the stairs .
he remained un@@ har@@ med but the video of the Falls spread rapidly across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by statements by MPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
in the past month they had booked him up and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that immunity will end in Parliament , and once they leave parliament their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard builds up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will divide into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and its service activities .
the expected job breakdown leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; thus an explanation of the company .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electro @-@ installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the turning of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is no greater issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd &apos;s investigation lists 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players that need a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites to go ahead with Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from the far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open itself is now even more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ ates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common among men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear vigor@@ ously , li@@ fes@@ tively and successfully , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck really .
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all of that came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case even though they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff member of the telephone ministry told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and suicide is really clear to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when trying to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to break Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria will be making use of PS@@ G , to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before finally reaching their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they asp@@ ire not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no clas@@ sy of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back , even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I &apos;m sorry we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could last a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian flu@@ gel@@ horn was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he finished beautiful in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which hit Celtic in an play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but except for a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some fla@@ ws and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ ung@@ ed in the first half in no less than five experiments and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shooting which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour &apos;s mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could hold the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers $ 2.5 billion through sale of shares
the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , which is affected by falling commodity prices , gathered $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth around CHF 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with declining commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of London stock exchange at the early Wednesday morning trading price .
the share was 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new particip@@ ations to 125 P@@ ence per share , which represents a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares valued at up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns related to long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar
on Tuesday , 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a usually long flight .
the refugees are from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia .
the youngest member is a six month old girl from Syria .
the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on September 25 and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosting Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state dinner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American Chinese collaboration in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi give the opportunity to construc@@ tively tackle areas of dis@@ agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , will likely meet several U.S. technology leaders on their way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi &apos;an address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber spi@@ on@@ age in China and increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .
440 @-@ hp sports car bor@@ rowed and driven to scrap
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfill a dream and made a Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang .
on the rainy highway the nasty awakening came .
at a company in the region of Go@@ tha , one can fulfil the dream and rent a V8 US sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang Boss 30@@ 2 with 440 b@@ hp .
so this also did a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the County of Go@@ tha .
on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt the dream was then over and over .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got into the spin on a wet track and drove into the guard rail .
the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured .
the property damage is estimated to be 40,000 EUR .
X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world Champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup champion , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , two times champion champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was already in front of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won anything at that time , we do nothing , &quot; he tells .
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ &apos;s &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the grass , switched the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in movie creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not at the scor@@ ing of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comment@@ aries of the actor of The Marti@@ an intensified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ urt beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat down to the film for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ witter users Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet deserved more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 le@@ kes since its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against imports .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album sil@@ ently matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ les invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first Champion
professional sports climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition @-@ show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who completed all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten up to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never had more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to the Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he holds a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been renewed for an eighth season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tiger sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers have been reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb up in a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three ranks .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw any game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit match since he had four hits against Seattle naval on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the throat well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said popul@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( impact training ) , looked much better from the bull@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game .
with three ranks at the end of the seventh inning , the tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who tore a two @-@ run out of the right @-@ h@@ anders Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a double play .
it was the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was playing a double play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inning , Wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , made S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game by an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had missed more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers moved in second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not beaten very well but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three ranks with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the wor@@ l@@ boards .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August due to a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three matches at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to attend in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , how the city of Wiesbaden cured on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the last ten days alone , according to the government president responsible for the initial admission , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective bar@@ gaining &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the Kel@@ b of a military participation in Germany had passed .
&quot; now the conflict ends crashing through our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , which could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Safety and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary .
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the coming Tuesday ( September 22 ) , the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the first @-@ generation and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced at the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ line Merkel , those people who needed protection , complain this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view has been dealt with in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania was set up with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking alternative routes across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , there were thousands of other migrants on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; takes place on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean flo@@ ats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raum@@ son@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets .
this tac@@ tic movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a continuous solid Ascension body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s south pole in 2006 , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles , thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers concluded back then .
the extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must rel@@ inqu@@ ish about one month to Val@@ det R@@ ama .
the association with@@ held an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury from the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is estimated to be four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ability to demonstrate its ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week .
already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at the head .
but contrary to his first app@@ reh@@ en@@ sions , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his lean line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy however : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits are thus supported by sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone tells nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and should be consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sa@@ vory dishes a special touch .
it moder@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaves such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the U@@ PS US package service represents up to 9@@ 5,000 aids for the Christmas business in the United States .
the company has already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
especially drivers are wanted .
last year , U@@ PS had raised 9@@ 5,000 aids for the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the package services .
first fo@@ al storm , then distinctive cold front
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming night , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaks through the valleys of the alpine side of the hair @-@ dryer , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday and at night on Thursday the F@@ öhn wind blows with storm strength through the fo@@ stering valleys .
after the com@@ promis@@ ist on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area on the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest @-@ current .
on the alpine side of the Alps breaks through the valleys during the night to Wednesday the F@@ öhn wind through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up until Thursday morning in the trou@@ ghs with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and specially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can probe until into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even Or@@ kan@@ bö@@ le are possible of over 120 km / h possible .
while on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer takes care of summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , humidity begins to st@@ ow down on the slope of the Alps .
it ra@@ ins here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , a total of more than 100 litres of rain per square meter is expected to be calculated in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , since large quantities of rainf@@ all have fallen in recent days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn wind out , as a result , a cold front is rolling with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind pi@@ cks up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German re@@ former .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live their faith in the town of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place is symbo@@ lically visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) found himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a welcome sin b@@ abel .
his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment Luther , Luther began the division of the Western Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar Alt Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of All Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cycles that focus on topics such as cross @-@ way , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity are born .
with this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into contemporary contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , he formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ Dog order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to re@@ work that , perhaps to carry me back with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to restore art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertising , and it is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is pushed out there .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them look at themselves , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not take care not to grasp the Bible completely , but chose the most important , mysterious themes for him .
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn drew near
plans were made , space found , company commissioned to model earth hills for a circular course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway , it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ uss , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railway .
so hill bev@@ elled , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , the first joint expert Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga is putting a clear signal on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program will continue to 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the federal states also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear signal when they will carry the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are football feder@@ alists , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig said of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on Friday , the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championship of Quali@@ fication against Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements in their places had started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year and next year , together with the DF@@ B and the Federal Government , the association will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have called all the sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reported to several reports that a fall in early July has lost the left eye .
after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen to a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ eds , has f@@ ain@@ ted , has then dra@@ gged out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of skir@@ mish ...

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also miss the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot use it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high burden of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change his 11th position on the R@@ eus position .
thus he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master keeper Roman citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with high probability he will also deny the second game .
the for@@ sche remark from fellow players R@@ eus that the final suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal is keeping mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the federal cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Mobility Age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure fewer jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the Transport Ministry &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid switching on digital radio .
a test track is currently being developed on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany , for example , wants to use internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , road@@ worth@@ less vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros in 20@@ 25 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian , S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly defined .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent will only count in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents charge up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of the digital video Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , this could be 15 percent in traffic and 45 percent in traffic .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l predic@@ ts team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current status , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf wants to open only in singles from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship program in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; back then Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world rank@@ ings fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

laugh@@ ing at H@@ enny H@@ enny
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look frigh@@ tening thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which will be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 to the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Canada &apos;s Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed artwork that was used for much effort : to fres@@ hen the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
the makers have m@@ apped 14 tons of material according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the dis@@ car@@ ding of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , how Gau@@ l@@ tier talked about in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
in the past , it went on to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meter .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a great quantity for customers , who for example processed them to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work any more today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ aries .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ dry lace fashion played a larger role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past eras , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
we already have half of all orders with us .
mo@@ oring P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien together with nine other companies .
only they must bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have broken away .
private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
also weak@@ est export , current to Russia and the United States .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the Stick@@ man in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at Schne@@ e@@ berger Arbeits@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - specializing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and spi@@ kes .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region one must find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip .
the machine sti@@ ckers small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ vil@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to play a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of its classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical infant girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already says : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open itself more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping stated on Tuesday a group charged with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee to deep@@ en a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it has a major role in the allocation of resources , safegu@@ ards a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ border value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thereby for@@ ge a significantly higher dose of nerve toxins to the consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organisation F@@ ood@@ mill , who has a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ win@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
but F@@ ood@@ win@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they keep the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o therefore is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious de@@ fle@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal for human beings , which strongly enri@@ ches itself over the food chain , especially in predat@@ ory fishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause especially in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations run more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total amount of coal em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
