&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures involved in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on the procedures involved in the implementation of the provisions of Part I .
the aim of the prevention measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core @-@ explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of early discovery .
to submit the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , associ@@ ating with the spatial enc@@ ro@@ achment and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the tests by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the material quantity demanded for a particular period of time is not specified for a specified period under specification of the exact limits for the specified amounts .
in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organisation according to article 3 makes full use of the Community &apos;s security system .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance areas .
in the application of their security measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and , as far as necessary , see how they are closer and useful in the supple@@ mentary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise derived from the stock of removed core material and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and the accuracy of the measurements and the estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Meas@@ ures to determine , test and evaluate differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and recei@@ vers ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing the accumulation of unnecessary hol@@ dings and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a log and report system , which shows the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory including the inputs and outputs of the balance sheet zone ;
g ) arrangements that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) to refund reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this Convention do not extend to material in mining or in the processing of ore .
B ) is introduced to the States ur@@ anium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the core fl@@ aring cycle , into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving the core material that is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other , in a later phase of the core fuel @-@ based core material is introduced into the states , it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to securing measures according to this Convention , is pro@@ visi@@ onally not possible or desirable from resi@@ du@@ es , so consult the organization and the community to each other via the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ profitable .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in gram@@ mes or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to safegu@@ ards according to this Convention , from these hed@@ ging measures , if the entire , due to this Article in the States fre@@ ed core material quantity at no time is more than
a ) a total of a kilo@@ grams of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 % ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 % ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
the core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures following this Convention , so precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the Organization supple@@ mentary agreements necessary to the extent that is necessary for the successful and effective assessment of the organisation &apos;s tasks according to the Convention , in the individual as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable .
the supple@@ mentary agreements cannot be extended or changed without amend@@ ment to this Convention in the agreement between the Organization and the Community .
the supple@@ mentary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements within n@@ in@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on Article 62 of the initial report , the organization establishes a consolidated inventory of the total , the safegu@@ ards of this convention underlying core material in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their veri@@ fications .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imp@@ eded by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ age problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months after the agreement enters into force , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the medium bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has submitted a table , which is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organisation is governed by a special account under the name &quot; Special Rap@@ tor account , &quot; which will help the Member States under this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to by the organization as a manager of tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous and used ( in this property the organisation is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is separated and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest gu@@ ilt of the Member State , which must be paid in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as the car@@ et@@ aker of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited in the country in question .
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrative stipul@@ ated time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rema@@ inder of the contribution to January 1 , 1979 or at a different time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may wish to make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about propor@@ tion@@ ate drawing on cash or the Notes in order to cover the expendi@@ tures for the special transaction loans and compens@@ ate for the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the gran@@ ting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan agreements without conc@@ essions ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
every transaction loan serves to finance a clearly out@@ dated and rapidly pay@@ able development program or sub@@ project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the organization funded by the organization , which is to be taken into account under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions which are generally applicable to the loans granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able at ten years of age in 50 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amounts to pay this b@@ rist@@ watch are to be paid directly to the organization it reserves .
any special transaction is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is given .
the proceeds from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization , and those defined by the applicant at the time of loan granted , may be recipient of a special transaction .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans shall be transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be returned as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker shall inform the E@@ EC for the complete allocation of all transaction loans to the E@@ EC concerning the purposes and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors .
during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker is teaching the E@@ WG quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures required for this .
the Administr@@ ators con@@ veys the E@@ EC as soon as possible after exp@@ ir@@ ation of the financial year of the organization a detailed invo@@ icing of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC shall soon as soon as possible provide a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the deposits paid to the Member States are evident .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete issu@@ ance of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time will exchange views on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action plans and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the E@@ EC and the organisation may not be entered into force , the agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be invalid with immediate effect .
if the entire amount of capital of all recei@@ vers accepted by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures in question .
the Secretary @-@ General manages these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ crip@@ ts written in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each word is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the App@@ endi@@ x A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ TION ER@@ LA@@ SS@@ EN :

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BIS could close a stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make an appropriate application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by credi@@ tor country , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment schedule of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions have been mentioned below which the BI@@ Z would be ready for .
in every stand@@ by loan , BI@@ Z would initially take up an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , but without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as with their event@@ ual extension the BI@@ Z would charge a credit reference commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw @-@ ups will not be made before the end of a month after the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ Z at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be negoti@@ ated taking into account the funds of the bank , probably three or six months .
conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z applies at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if the BI@@ Z does not have to obtain the necessary means by itself on the market , then the interest rate next to the application could reach a maximum , corresponding to the Li@@ bor raised by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .

C ) the &quot; maintenance situation &quot; is deemed to be &quot; favourable , &quot; if 1 . data on population dynamics indicate that the wander@@ ing species claims to be a viable part of its ecos@@ ystems long @-@ term ;
2. the spread @-@ area of the wander@@ ing species is neither pre@@ mat@@ urely , nor seen in the long term , to be restricted in the future ;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I ad@@ here to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to determine provisions on import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or ch@@ illed chicken - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the import duties for the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of Argentina after the community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in battle body weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina ple@@ dges to ensure that the amount of the annual quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or frozen ) .
should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and in trading , the two parties agree to each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned under the number 10 to find a reasonable solution .
in the event that the community takes the safeguard cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina has not been affected by this agreement on the common market .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amounts in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year .
the community agre@@ es to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the products recorded by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
at the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount set under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian commerce with each new Member State .
the bur@@ dens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; on this occasion , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ etter of Value referred to in the number 5 will be taken into account .
the total amount mentioned under the number 2 will be fixed with the day of accession of Greece to the Community to 23 000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions to prevent the sales of frozen meat from frozen meat as a result of the regulation laying down the paragraph of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual use of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from cont@@ emp@@ t for certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will be met only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are expressed in a way which is compatible with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by giving the quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this Agreement for the products listed under the number 1 .
in turn , the community agre@@ es to make all necessary arrangements so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products is made dependent on the presentation of a export license which is given by the responsible body designated by the Argent@@ inian government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of import licence for the frag@@ mentary products .
in terms of implementation , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals has informed the amounts for export licensing ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly examines the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned under the No. 7 target .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this Agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products from the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat will be carried out under the agreement of not named collective numbers .
the committee disc@@ usses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be exemp@@ ted from the rights and obligations of the parties within the scope of the GAT@@ T .
the annual quantity specified under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement until January 1 of the following year is set in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a time limit of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes which they consider comprehensi@@ ble for necessary .
I would be grateful if you would share your government &apos;s consent to this .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :

agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat
I ad@@ here to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to determine provisions on import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of hammer and lamb meat are exist@@ ential following the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that the normal sale of new ze@@ al oil and lamb meat is not imp@@ aired on these markets , I ad@@ here to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or ch@@ illed chicken - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is assured for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat &apos;s meat of access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sale of its hammer - and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the amount prescribed by the end of the year does not exceed the specified amount .
the pre @-@ assembled quantities are carried out in conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community affir@@ ms that New Zealand should not be prevented with this agreement to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and in trading , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned in cl@@ ause 10 to find a reasonable solution .
in the event that the community takes the safeguard cl@@ ause , it is obliged to protect themselves from New Zealand &apos;s interests resulting from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed amounts , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the products recorded by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand will change the amounts specified in cl@@ ause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trading with each new Member State .
the bur@@ dens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz of exhaus@@ tion will be taken into account in cl@@ ause 5 .
the total amount mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 will be fixed with the day of accession of Greece to the Community to 245 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass body weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and Lamm@@ meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions to prevent the ship@@ ments of frozen meat from frozen meat because of the implementation of the Regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the two contracting parties do everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ lei@@ sch in the community without risk for market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual use of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from cont@@ emp@@ t for certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be met at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community in world trade with these products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 in particular by giving no export licenses over these quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in turn , the community agre@@ es to make all necessary arrangements so that obtaining import licenses for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in New Zealand will be made dependent on the presentation of a export license which is granted by the New Zealand government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of import licence for the frag@@ mentary products .
furthermore , quot@@ ation regulations stipul@@ ate that the competent New Zealand Authority records the amounts reported to the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals , for export licensing ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
the committee regularly checks the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both contracting parties and on the global market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned in cl@@ ause 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products from h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out under the agreement .
the Committee shall discuss all the issues arising in the implementation of the agreement , which shall be submitted to it by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be exemp@@ ted from the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the scope of the GAT@@ T .
the amount stated in cl@@ ause 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount of the year applicable by the entry into force of this agreement will be set in relation to the total annual amount .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand as well as for the main area of New Zealand on the other hand .
this agreement will take effect on 20 October 1980 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a time limit of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement shall be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ad@@ here to suggest if your government can agree to the above that this letter and your reply write together an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ad@@ here to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to determine provisions on import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a human whole blood is taken from a healthy person and blood mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
blood removal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a ster@@ ile bottle through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system , into which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was fu@@ elled prior to sterili@@ sation .
after termination of the blood removal the bottle is immediately to be closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards it may only be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution must not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration must not exceed 97 g per liter .
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously determined by the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is performed by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .

the human whole blood is in ster@@ ile , sealed bottle protected from micro @-@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during the time required for testing and transport , which may exceed 30 minutes at most , to which the blood immediately is cooled to 4 to 6 C .
a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the biggest part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution , which was added after removal of the plasma .
the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approxim@@ ate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is indicated on the label .
all processes required for manufacturing must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the export must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by pressure .
if an artificial water solution has been added , its volume and composition can also be applied on the label .
the human dry plasma is obtained by de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid that is depos@@ ited at the top of cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ ation or sedi@@ ment of human whole blood .
the human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
the dry product can easily be dissolved in a water quantity which corresponds to the amount of fluid from which it was used in the production of the substance .
protein concentrations of the so @-@ extracted solution must not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which ( using a cream tasting ) a dangerous content of I@@ so@@ h@@ äm@@ oly@@ sin or immune hem@@ at@@ glut@@ in@@ ine have been determined are excluded .
if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml .
in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood donations which exhibit a bacterial infection are not used ; the ster@@ ility of any donation has to be proven in a blood volume of at least 10 ml .
in order to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ kul@@ ative h@@ epatitis , the plasma is to take mix@@ tures that do not contain more than 12 donations , or to use other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner .
one of the amount of fluid from which the plasma is used , corresponding amount of water is added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantity plasma is dissolved in the water quantity , which corresponds to the amount of fluid from which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :
the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 C with a sufficient amount of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de .
due to the 24@@ stu@@ ffer drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ox@@ ides under a pressure of at most 0.0@@ 2 mm mercury may not occur in the human dry plasma loss of weight over 0.5 % .

signing of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the Desig@@ nation and Co@@ ding of Goods ( Events in Brussels on 24 June 1986 )
the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the Cust@@ oms Department
it is desirable that on June 14 , 1983 , the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the Desig@@ nation and Co@@ ding of Goods will enter into force on 1 January 1988 .
in the allocation that without a change in Article 13 of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned Convention , the time of entry into force of this Convention would remain in@@ secure -
in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the Desig@@ nation and Co@@ ding of Goods , referred to in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , paragraph 1 contains the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) This agreement enters into force on 1 January following the exp@@ ir@@ ation of at least three months immediately , at least sevent@@ een of the states designated in Article 11 or Cust@@ oms or Economic Comm@@ ons have signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or denied their rati@@ fication or affili@@ ation certificates , but not before 1 January 1988 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A. This protocol simultaneously enters into force with the Convention , provided that at least sevent@@ een of the States or Cust@@ oms or Business Comm@@ ons designated in Article 11 of the Convention concerning the adoption of the Protocol at the Secretariat of the Council for cooperation in the field of customs .
however , only states or customs or business uni@@ ons can deposit the document on the adoption of this protocol , which previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or at the same time under@@ lining their document of rati@@ fication or the accession to the Convention or at the same time .
B. E@@ ach state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention after the entry into force of this Protocol referred to in paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the am@@ ended version .
- a plant that is indispensable not only for entertainment and conservation of land , but also allows the utilization of land , which does not permit any other plant@@ ing , and even with extensive cultivation which constitutes the main part of today &apos;s production , re@@ acts to any improvement of the cultivation methods ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that from cultivation it depends on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which in turn depend entirely on measures aimed at maintaining and extending the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the non @-@ producing countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to DAR@@ BY , olive oil and table olive oil are essential ingredients in the fields in which olive cultivation is common ;
in view of DAR@@ ON , the essential characteristic of olive production is the regul@@ arity of the harv@@ ests and the market supply , and that this leads to fluctu@@ ations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer revenues ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of DAR@@ E that this causes all particular difficulties which can seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the general policy of economic growth in the countries where the olive cultivation is common ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under NOTE , the extraordinary significance of olive production for the economy of numerous countries , especially the olive growing countries currently under development ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of DAR@@ E that the measures required in the face of the special circumstances of olive growing and the market for olive products go beyond national borders and that international action is indispensable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the BET@@ RA@@ CHT of the 1956 International Olive Oil Convention , in its am@@ ended version and the International Olive oil convention from 1963 in its multiple extended and am@@ ended version and the 1979 International Olive Oil Convention ;
