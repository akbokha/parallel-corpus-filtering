<seg id="659">Each State applies to the organization, including its assets, funds and assets, as well as to its inspectors and other officials to fulfill the tasks according to this Convention, the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prerogatives and liberations of the International Atomic Energy Organization.</seg>
<seg id="660">The securing measures following this agreement are terminated in relation to core material if the community and organization realize that the material has been consumed or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activity, which is under the point of view of the security measures of Belang, or has practically not been recoverable.</seg>

<seg id="669">The organisation will be held over the total amount and composition of this material on the state or the states concerned and on any transmission of such material from this state or state.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains their consent to as swiftly as possible; it extends only to matters such as temporal and procedural provisions and agreements for reporting, but does not exclude approval or secrecy of military activity and does not refer to the unsuccessful use of the core material.</seg>
<seg id="671">The organization, the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention.</seg>

<seg id="676">If the Council considers the relevant information submitted by the Director General to ensure that the organisation is not capable of verifying itself by verifying that no core material, which has to be protected under this Convention, must be reimbursed for nuclear weapons or other nuclear radiators, so he can reimburse the reports provided in Article XII (C) of the Statutes and, if necessary, the other measures stipulated there.</seg>
<seg id="677">In such steps, the Council takes into consideration the extent to which measures have been achieved by the applied hedging measures, and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - any justifiable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security.</seg>

<seg id="696">The aim of the prevention measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the branching of significant quantities of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core-explosives for unknown purposes, as well as deterrence from such a junction by the risk of early discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">To submit the target specified in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, associating with the spatial encroachment and observation as important complementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the tests by the organization is carried out by an explanation, in which the material quantity demanded for a particular period of time is not specified for a specified period under specification of the exact limits for the specified amounts.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their verifications, the organisation according to article 3 makes full use of the Community's security system.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance areas.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their security measures, the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and, as far as necessary, see how they are closer and useful in the supplementary agreements:</seg>

<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the medium bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC has submitted a table, which is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organisation is governed by a special account under the name "Special Raptor account," which will help the Member States under this agreement to the special transaction account; this account is referred to by the organization as a manager of treacherous and used (in this property the organisation is referred to as "caretaker"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may wish to make payments before the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedure of the organization, the caretaker takes about proportionate drawing on cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenditures for the special transaction loans and compensate for the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan agreements without concessions; and</seg>
