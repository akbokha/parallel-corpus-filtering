it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder in which the patients have man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods an@@ or@@ mal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and for the prevention of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ oral disorders if oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or sm@@ el@@ ting tablets in patients that make the swal@@ lo@@ wing of tablets trouble .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , as A@@ bili@@ fy should be broken down , A@@ bili@@ fy &apos;s dose should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , is less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate recep@@ tors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was examined in three studies lasting up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases caused by increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder leading to increased rest@@ lessness , with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment was investigated .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ b@@ ates the melt tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness compared with the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prev@@ ailed for up to 74 weeks than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously untreated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ amid@@ ales disturb@@ ances ( un@@ controlled sugar@@ s ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , nau@@ sea ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who mainly spoke man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to the risks .
furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission informed the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the whole European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes started to treat Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses above a 15 mg daily dose has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ indu@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
the inci@@ dence of suicide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no higher risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transmission disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms indicated on a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismis@@ sed .
for this reason Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients suffering from sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions associated with var@@ ic@@ con@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dose , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a side effect is known , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ pr@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dose re@@ ductions should be made .
with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism suffer@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ prot@@ e@@ as@@ one inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose re@@ ductions should be made .
after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , dosage should be raised from A@@ bili@@ fy to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( Dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ hic ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to insufficient data security in humans and because of the concerns raised in the animal &apos;s re@@ productive studies , this drug may not be used during pregnancy , unless the potential benefits clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned not to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ inson &apos;s , ath@@ oms , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , occurred in patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS increased 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients taking plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from ec@@ z@@ zap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I Dis@@ order - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occ@@ ured , no medi@@ cally significant differences occurred .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their inci@@ dence also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma cut connection .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder is transmitted over the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ Rezep@@ tor .
in the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ and , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ sch .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients , who retained a response to study medicine , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of scales , defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery as@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ rats scale , showed significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher return rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an E@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which comprised 314 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % was compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a plac@@ ebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated against plac@@ ebo based on the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania .
based on in vit@@ ro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ lic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabolism robots via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism robots via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ener patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the phar@@ ma k@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function on the phar@@ ma k@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ did@@ al potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions which have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ adren@@ al rin@@ se tox@@ icity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accum@@ ulations and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ fold mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeat@@ able oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 82@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were not more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study of 30 m@@ g. in the study , which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lo@@ wing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can use the melt tablets alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .

97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets amounted to 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injec@@ tions solution is used for quick control of in@@ anim@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine applied already for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Schmel@@ z@@ tabl@@ etten , or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions in patients with in@@ anim@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transmission disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a side effect is known or an un@@ healthy lifestyle is observed and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were used as intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly and simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ pr@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant .
in case of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism suffer@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - protein @-@ inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and therefore similar dose re@@ ductions should be made .
after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , dosage should be raised from A@@ bili@@ fy to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cular received , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :

107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS increased 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients taking plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occ@@ ured , no medi@@ cally significant differences occurred .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and whose inci@@ dence also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ality , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ str@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms in comparison with plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline value at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Com@@ ponent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients , who retained a response to study medicine , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of scales , defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ rats scale , showed significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher return rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an E@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which comprised 314 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study enhancement in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated against plac@@ ebo based on the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % greater in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injec@@ tions than tablet ; system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated application in a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 or 5 times above the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to intra@@ ven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ did@@ al potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions which have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; in this way , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se tox@@ icity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accum@@ ulations and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the 3 @-@ fold of the middle steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times of the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the middle steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine contained in a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , the main study was 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in relation to efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils prior to the beginning of treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that unlike other medicines , it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
at Sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ie Level 3 the treatment is to be broken until an improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ artic@@ ular formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have essentially other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils rise again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardiovascular tox@@ icity has not been proven , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease .
in case of the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ative methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm enhancement , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ versible bar@@ r@@ enness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the transport stability and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side @-@ effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly re@@ versible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of patients .
ana@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in trials ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced pot@@ assium in the blood heart disease :

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules ingredient that promotes the mer@@ ging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their poly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital Inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the Trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the course of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ ine recep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ ber@@ ing protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two asy@@ mmet@@ ric un@@ banned studies and 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparison study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second trial a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of sol@@ vent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results for the overall response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the Total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30 and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active substance exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentrations decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or consec@@ ration of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged ingredient was 4 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available to patients at the age of over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological agent that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which a blood trans@@ fusion complic@@ ation could occur if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , ana@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which em@@ powers them to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medicine when administered as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were changed to Ab@@ se@@ amed were uph@@ eld in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union the evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company called Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all Member States , including information about the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ ütter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of ana@@ emia and reduction of the trans@@ fusion requirement in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who received chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia during chemotherapy ) consists .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger operating procedures affecting a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml are applied , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients where hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall health ; therefore , the doctor is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of illness .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of ana@@ emia and ana@@ emia .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) might need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) might need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dosage increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
angi@@ omas and consequ@@ ential effects may vary depending on age , sex and overall health ; therefore , the doctor is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of illness .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required to control the An@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .

if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl , the dose should be maintained three times a week three times a week .

patients with mild ana@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ tions is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the ab@@ se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg free of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection may be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine into circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic at a er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ oma ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a ab@@ se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ y ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c intervention and which are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pro@@ s , cor@@ on@@ ary arter@@ ial oc@@ cl@@ usion , v@@ ascular disease of the Kar@@ oti@@ des or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ y ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to years with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effects , defined as reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ respon@@ sive ( ice , fol@@ ate acid , or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ ous tox@@ ic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te &quot; index &quot; ) is ab@@ normal ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row can be considered for a diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in section 4.2 should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit which is attri@@ but@@ able to the administration of epo@@ e@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration needed to control the angi@@ oma and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , treatment of ana@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should consider a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients that need to be tran@@ substanti@@ ated ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapies @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs , the cause of ana@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis as they have an increased risk of er@@ os@@ kel@@ etal and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be ruled out that for treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events may consist in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ines have not been proven that they improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
when epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vit@@ ro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al cor@@ als , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( brain bleeding , brain inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood don@@ ors to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications .
the gene@@ tically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate percentage identical to the endo@@ genous Human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ oses ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ om@@ es , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 further hem@@ og@@ lob@@ oses ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ ma car@@ cin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate cancer , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 more ) .

survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ y human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients with an@@ emia , due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ancies , consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life period of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life period of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels , which are achieved following intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) .
14 in the experimental studies with nearly the 20@@ stat of the recommended weekly dose to be used in humans epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased f@@ ö@@ red body weight , to a delay in the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in the fatal mort@@ ality .
these reports are based on in vit@@ ro findings with cells of human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

the holder of approval for placing on the market has to provide the medical specialist staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging contributions .
the owner of the authorisation for the placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application for authorisation has been established and functional before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is put into circulation .
the holder of the authorisation for the placing on the market comm@@ its itself to conduct the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) described in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as well as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plans ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan adopted by CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Human use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( periodi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information , which may have an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or measures for risk reduction • in 60 days after reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment , if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time asc@@ ending or reinforced chest pain ) , there is a risk of dro@@ ple@@ t formation in the v@@ eins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) , for example , if you have encountered such a blood c@@ rop@@ y in the past .
you suffer from severe bleeding disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripher@@ al arter@@ ial oc@@ cl@@ usion ) , the cer@@ vi@@ cal arter@@ ies ( v@@ ascular disease of the locom@@ otive ) or the brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent rise in the blood plat@@ el@@ et number , which re@@ forms during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid , should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before beginning of treatment .
very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ y after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin @-@ inj@@ ected ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie , it will break off your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your ana@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value reduces the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or increasing pot@@ assium levels , your doctor may take into consideration an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium values are again in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or peri@@ od@@ ont@@ al signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , treatment of blood poverty with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood pig@@ ment ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly , in order to keep the risk of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past have already occurred oste@@ o@@ otic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , the cause of your ana@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before treatment begins .
if your values of red blood pig@@ ment ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rho@@ sis after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will , if necessary , arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means to build the immune system , for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood im@@ pover@@ ishment ( ana@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large injec@@ tions .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how ana@@ emia respon@@ ds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this appropriate , also learn how to sy@@ ringe Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary circulation disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary ar@@ rays , v@@ ascular extensions ( A@@ neur@@ ys@@ men ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ y means that no more enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special caution when applying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after repeated blood donations , it may occur - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ( thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ) .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ pf@@ ishing after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ) if your starting model is too high

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with high frac@@ tures of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first inf@@ usion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta may reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta may be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the agent in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta .
the first study included nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
the main indicator for effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood is again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) , the risk of frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta side effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subjected to the risk of kidney complaints , reactions to the inf@@ usion centre and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( wi@@ ther@@ ing of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the placing of A@@ cl@@ asta in the whole European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long mission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily , at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen briefly after applying A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ atine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is present .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adol@@ escents A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years of age , as data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
before starting the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia should be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid to the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily , at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene , should be treated with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to the application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate .
for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen briefly after applying A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation in cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis trials ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ ZON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) of adverse drug effects are listed in chart 1 .
kidney dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated with decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as active kidney failure .
the changes in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the morph@@ ine Pag@@ et studies .
all patients received supple@@ mentary adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study aimed at avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Pag@@ et Pag@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study aimed at avoiding clinical frac@@ tures following a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area have been treated , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of the reports relates to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area in a patient treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and plac@@ ebo .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be obtained by offering oral calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the thig@@ h stroke ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing spine correction .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine structure A@@ cl@@ asta shr@@ ank significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ ral structures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta proved a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius significantly compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the thig@@ h neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology at 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic compound a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume in comparison with plac@@ ebo and the maintenance of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone structure .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ o@@ dic intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON RF@@ T study , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment increased the BM@@ D in total hip and thig@@ h compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in the overall frag@@ rances and by 4.3 % on the thig@@ h neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON RF@@ T study 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show decre@@ asing clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the inci@@ dence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ rate BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta was studied in patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone ( mean ser@@ um level of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.6 to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when included in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of cit@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six month trial could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ ed independent .
the plasma was then rapidly increasing &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ polar dis@@ appearance from the large circulation system with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early phases of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) pres@@ um@@ ably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ abolic substances by Cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irre@@ versible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ atine clearance , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine clearance , and was in the mean 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ atine clearance down to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
because for severe ren@@ al dys@@ functions ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ al intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and 0,6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
studies on dogs showed single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats with a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 6@@ ples of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the 6@@ jaw of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in accumulated ex@@ positions , which sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point .
the most common infection in trials with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ or of long bones in animals during the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats one observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of decreased ser@@ um @-@ calcium levels .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pag@@ et of the bone .
decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed out of andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pag@@ et Mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed in an un@@ ordered way , which makes the bone material we@@ aker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alising the bone structure again , ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta or other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs that is known to be harmful to the kid@@ neys .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta , along with food and drinks , worry that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions you will get enough flu@@ ids before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .

patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to make the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid to the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic ab@@ normal , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) ass@@ esses the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not displayed .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) that can not be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl di@@ ure@@ a or insulin , the current dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the account treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin is to be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ onic acid , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3,5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lo@@ wered if the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were lo@@ wered .
at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of the additional offering of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl is decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the addition of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , patients received ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and an@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high ket@@ one mirrors - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ work is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or int@@ oler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients affected by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing develop@@ mental neu@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase in the reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be monitored as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , over@@ size , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment up to the occurrence of laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which may arise from fatty deposits and in some cases connected to a fluid retention .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3,@@ 6 @-@ 4.2 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a second combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the introduction of the market , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on the appearance or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but decre@@ asing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients communicate with visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or enter it , treatment is canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one decreases in pregnancy resulting hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus dimin@@ ishes the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( out of this data not estimated ) .
these lead to a transi@@ ent change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ fraction of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents across the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the norm@@ ality range also often occur as plac@@ ebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ide .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the frequency of severe con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
since the introduction of the market it was rarely reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more frequently when it was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
there was a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in groups treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occ@@ ured .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be demonstrated that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time to desc@@ end of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite three months of optimisation with insulin were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.45 % , compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year at Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was observed in comparison to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was reduced compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de , the total plas@@ tic@@ ity gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant rise in the L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel was detected in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing develop@@ mental mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either a pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo for over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ tor ) increases or lo@@ wers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
following oral use of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the precip@@ itation ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with limited ren@@ al function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother substance are similar .
tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and re@@ versible ec@@ centric hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ ine decreases and thus dimin@@ ishes the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an resulted in increased inci@@ dence of col@@ ont@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ ine / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was observed in clinical studies over 1 year compared to the initial values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study l@@ acked the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular risks are associated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparable medication , there was an increased inci@@ dence of bone frac@@ tures in women .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice a day if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced to a similar extent to another human insulin analog .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose adjustment has significantly improved by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy may change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ polar , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients for medicines taken by them .
4 So@@ well hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can cause un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent dis@@ rup@@ tions of the brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system occasional - Peri@@ pher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood glucose control can be associated with dis@@ comfort referred to as acute pain neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually re@@ versible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with a ab@@ rupt improvement in blood glucose adjustment can however be associated with a temporary degra@@ dation of di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the under@@ body tissue coll@@ ateral - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection point can develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the in@@ sti@@ ch@@ ment within the injection area .
general conditions and complaints at the place of administration Yellow - Local over @-@ sensitivity reactions in the injection centre Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) .
diseases of the immune system occasional - Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms generated hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ otic ede@@ ma , breathing problems , heart p@@ alp@@ itations , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence / un@@ consciousness .
however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated with the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its , or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help sper@@ son or by glucose , which is intra@@ ven@@ ously given by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effect lasts up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of winding ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molec@@ ule have been considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the spl@@ itting is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , to car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
it is recommended - after the acet@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane is taken out of the fridge - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is retired according to the instruction manual for the first use .

12 So@@ well hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o .
13 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with a ab@@ rupt improvement in blood glucose adjustment can however be associated with a temporary degra@@ dation of di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life ( t ½ ) is therefore rather a measure of res@@ or@@ ption as a measure of elimination per se of insulin from the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of only a few minutes ) .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the whole European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin is first to be raised , followed by the amount of insulin that is long acting .
3 If a dosage adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who are already showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or tox@@ ins ( &quot; stones , &quot; which may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , tox@@ ins may still occur , so it is recommended that patients with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic may take other medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with that of a plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once daily during the last three measurements showed a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
this was compared with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits ( including one of the clinical history known or currently present ) and / or arthritis .
if the ser@@ um acid level still amounts to 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , dosage can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .

in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or self @-@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the treatment with Feb@@ u ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ esi@@ on@@ ous medicines , it can come to an acute attack during treatment due to the reduction of the ser@@ um @-@ har@@ sh@@ ouse @-@ pi@@ eg@@ els at first bru@@ te acid deposits in the tissue can be mobili@@ sed .
B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , slight changes of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ . ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of February treatment and in the subsequent course ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ wart did not have any in@@ tra @-@ effect studies to Feb@@ . ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll @-@ mirror ( an inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous offering of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times was associated with an increase in February exposure exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in undes@@ irable events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or at the same time required other active substance .
in a study involving subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine , an CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ azi@@ da It could be demonstrated that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide contains , the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of ex@@ pon@@ ed pregn@@ ancies can not be concluded on the side effects of February at the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not det@@ ri@@ mental to its performance .
a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ eb@@ uk@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0,3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ . ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ . ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no heavy r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long term extension studies were treated 90@@ 6 patients for up to 1 year , 322 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with Feb@@ . ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ro@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occ@@ ured in patients who received February ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hyp@@ a@@ esth@@ esia , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short@@ ness , skin inflamm@@ ations , l@@ esi@@ ons , con@@ ges@@ tion , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in the concentration of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline in the number of white blood cells .
the action mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises in the context of the reac@@ tion@@ sk@@ ask@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ pur@@ in @-@ sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vit@@ ro @-@ inhibit@@ ing located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients receiving the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um secre@@ tion value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg every day .
patients with ser@@ um secre@@ tion ( 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ized for analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
reducing the level of ser@@ um levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in week 2 at the doctor &apos;s visit and kept permanently throughout the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um secre@@ tion &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg . 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg . 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of the ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe ren@@ al dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl , about 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the inci@@ dence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a re@@ plen@@ ishment ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ out node size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ U / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration period curve ( AU@@ C ) of February after administration were easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase of AU@@ C is observed for February at February , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg . 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um acid concentration was observed , if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the micro@@ scope binding of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 99.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id primarily occurs through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its well known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as an unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
specific patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Klassi@@ fikation B ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Klassi@@ fikation B ) , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In males rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ om@@ es and car@@ cin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with about the 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ met@@ ation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that Feb@@ ro@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about the 4 @-@ fold of the human@@ ist exposure , mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity occ@@ ured , which accompanied by lowering the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the desc@@ endant of rats .
Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 4.3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times the human@@ therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or at the same time required other active substance .
di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no heavy r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
21 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long term extension studies were treated 90@@ 6 patients for up to 1 year , 322 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with Feb@@ . ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients receiving the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

the owner of the authorisation for placing the medicine has certain to ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is ready before the drug is brought into circulation , and as long as the drug is brought into circulation .
an updated R@@ MP is to be presented in accordance with the CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on risk management systems for human medicine with the next periodi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • when new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to risk minim@@ ization • within 60 days after reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of E@@ MEA
in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ sol@@ uble .
if you keep the acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystals is prevented and thus achieved with time a reduction of the dis@@ comfort .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the agent Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medication , if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . if you are treated with a high ur@@ ic acid concentration following a canc@@ er@@ ary disease or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ Syn@@ dro@@ ms ( a rare con@@ genital disorder in which too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood is found ) .
if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , heat and joint sw@@ elling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before you begin with the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , in order to prevent a sei@@ z@@ ure attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint sw@@ elling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use drugs that may appear in the following substances as interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor might want to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ ur@@ in ( for the treatment of cancer ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine ( for the treatment of as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
no studies have been carried out on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on the transport stability and the ability to serve machines .
therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC only after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from an int@@ oler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , the individual week@@ days are printed so you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food .
if you have un@@ inten@@ tionally taken an over@@ dose , please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital .
if you forgot the intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , get it as soon as possible unless the next intake is just before .
if you break the intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , your acid concentration can increase again , and your dis@@ comfort may wor@@ sen because new pri@@ mal crystals can form in your joints and kid@@ neys as well as their environment .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 can already be used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low @-@ vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those used exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also stipul@@ ates that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of diges@@ tive appar@@ at@@ uses such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ c@@ era ) , ul@@ c@@ ers , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lo@@ wing ) , asc@@ ending abdom@@ en ( blocked abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ res .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other constitu@@ ent components AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be used in case of diseases of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , lab@@ eled with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is available only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not che@@ w the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ation . • The patients should not take place before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ oph@@ age@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ation and es@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ oph@@ age@@ al lines , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( sometimes these were severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of vi@@ es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lo@@ wing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that indicate es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
during large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no higher risk was detected , rare ( after market introduction ) gast@@ ric and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ oses , among them some serious and with complications , have been reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment was mainly intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there is no data available to indicate whether the risk of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a jaw @-@ surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is author@@ it@@ ative for the treatment planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised to take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE after having noticed their om@@ is@@ ition .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the dose of one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequ@@ ately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron no indication of direct fo@@ aming effects with regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but also oste@@ opor@@ osis patients were reported .
nevertheless , decreases of ser@@ um calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occur in both treatment groups with similar inci@@ dence .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at of oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ or@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract like stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ al .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the transformation of 7 Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ us to vitamin D3 .
the main action of 1.25 @-@ di@@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal res@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as regul@@ ating ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .

after 15 @-@ week treatment the mean ser@@ um level of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D was significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) as in the group under al@@ end@@ ron@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) decreased significantly after 15 weeks in patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 3@@ 7,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at &apos;s therapeutic equi@@ val@@ ence once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the Fra@@ ktur @-@ Inter@@ ven@@ tions@@ - Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 459 ) .
in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day amounted to 8.@@ 8 % in the plac@@ ebo , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur neck and 7.@@ 8 % at the con@@ sol@@ der .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved in comparison with plac@@ ebo group in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more frac@@ tures .
during the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained .
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Ret@@ ri@@ pt on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after ni@@ ghtly fast and two hours prior to intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats showed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ part@@ ments .
after an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and system@@ ic clearance exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that in humans it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In addition of radio@@ active marked vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.6 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although no clinical data is present , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in animal trials will also be reduced in patients with limited ren@@ al function .
therefore , in patients with limited ren@@ al function , a somewhat elevated accumulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate can be expected in bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ through the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously completed trials with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example investigated how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t have been conducted and analysed how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f as the dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changing the formulation or regime should only be conducted under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
following a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations &quot; )
after conversion from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , the adjustment of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ graf 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application Dur@@ ing the supp@@ ression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendation - ren@@ al transplan@@ tation pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation following transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - Li@@ ver Tran@@ splan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tation Canc@@ ell@@ ation The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ graf capsules at once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day , treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis recommended in ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ ts must begin daily for pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
transplan@@ tation In case of adult patients who are transplan@@ ted to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day .
other gra@@ ft recei@@ vers Ob@@ wohl there is no clinical experience with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lun@@ gen@@ - , pan@@ cre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , in pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood @-@ tal@@ ons in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it may be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um canc@@ ers , a calculation of the cre@@ atine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of the blood in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in an individual case under the aid of whole blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels .
it is recommended frequent inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ graf to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the bottom level in the blood exceeds 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the tal@@ low level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the thorou@@ gh@@ bred in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and ar@@ enal - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t reactions or other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changing the formulation or regime should only be done under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recei@@ vers and gra@@ ft recei@@ vers in childhood are not yet available in clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effectiveness of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations in such conditions .
in rare cases , a chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons due to suitable clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision disturb@@ ances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) should show .
as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , l@@ act@@ ose contain , special care is required in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies have resulted in the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus caused by inhibit@@ ing g@@ astro@@ intestinal flu@@ ids .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism is imp@@ aired .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the exposure of hormon@@ al exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially decrease the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long its half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ t patients have no indication that in comparison with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events regarding the course and outcome of pregnancy .
uter@@ o exposure is recommended to monitor the new@@ born to any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ ana@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant drugs can be detected often due to the under@@ under@@ ing of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
following are the side effects following their frequency in desc@@ ending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1.000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1.000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , not known ( frequency based on the available data not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As is known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have often increased sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of Virus @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ties including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disease and skin tum@@ ours associated with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
effect mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to convey the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ an protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection within the cellular nucle@@ i .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction problems in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus suppres@@ ses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent on the T cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ins ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor .

results of the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of Pro@@ graf twice daily after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ graf has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant after pan@@ cre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tations .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ graf in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ graf was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recei@@ vers for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ graf , more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was less frequent in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients were in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 38.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7,@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the action @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the inci@@ dence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric study conducted with oral pro@@ graf was performed to 205 patients receiving pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ised trial of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( via protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired level of 8 to 15 ng / ml per 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ graf as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ gins , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist dac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to levels between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently gra@@ ft radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as low hem@@ at@@ omas and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the frac@@ tion@@ ated fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a rein@@ forcement of met@@ abolic induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearing @-@ rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile .
in stable patients treated by Pro@@ graf ( twice daily ) on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposition of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approxim@@ ate 10 % lower than under Pro@@ graf .
it is recommended frequent inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( caused by lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advances are applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as ble@@ edings in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but manufactured according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling them to form the human scent factor VIII .
adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is manufactured differently so that the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic periods with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ata ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ata may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human ger@@ inn@@ ation factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the Factor VIII @-@ activity should not fall below the specified concentrations of plasma ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions an appropriate determination of the Factor VIII concentration of the plasma .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ edings in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the dosage speed is to be directed according to the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the Pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ulation activity of Factor VIII . Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ position@@ ists and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically well @-@ known In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory Development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s experienced in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , at none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or was established .
previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side @-@ effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms occ@@ ured which were referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the regi@@ stran@@ t should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee on Human Use Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company res@@ umes its application for the transfer of adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that bind other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that no copies of itself can be produced and thus no infection can trigger people .
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable cancer cells to re@@ constitute the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the p@@ 53 gene existing in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Wi@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the under@@ body , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions presented to him , some questions were still un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the documents submitted , CH@@ MP creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ancing can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company does not know the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ al sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adol@@ escents from the age of 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food completely with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are de@@ pl@@ eted .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when examining all ha@@ y @-@ fever symptoms , the patients who took the aer@@ ate , reported a decrease in the symptoms of 46.@@ 0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
when only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients under Aer@@ ina@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any other component , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for treating allergi@@ es ) .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glau@@ coma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or v@@ ascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by the European Commission for the transport of aer@@ ob@@ atics throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cr@@ ushing , breaking or che@@ wing ) .
aer@@ ob@@ ics should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the absence of data to harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after blades of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as for long @-@ term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time .
after the sw@@ elling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if required .
since Aer@@ ina@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after finishing such a therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity associated with combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiva , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ rac@@ olin etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient body and the data does not suff@@ ice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ ics were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data does not suff@@ ice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or p@@ alp@@ itations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hy@@ dati@@ d so@@ b@@ stru@@ ktion or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is available at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent .
in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo independent of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ ate during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ob@@ ics should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that , in very rare cases , it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ lement that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the transport stability or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a C@@ NS depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal cur@@ sions .
head@@ aches , anxiety , difficult micro , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart@@ beat , p@@ pit@@ ations , thir@@ st , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , pre@@ operative pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturb@@ ances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - dil@@ ation , skin t@@ rough@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flu@@ gli@@ ding , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended doses of 5 m@@ g. daily showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients aged 12 to 78 years participated in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 414 patients receiving aer@@ ob@@ ac@@ ic tablets .
in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine effectiveness of aer@@ ate tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nas@@ al skin sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ate tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al skin sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ate tablets did not show significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of an individual dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ate , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ ina@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine reached day 10 .
as part of a phar@@ ma@@ co@@ k@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine poor@@ ly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure after the gift of an aer@@ ate tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not reveal any special haz@@ ards to humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .

for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adol@@ escents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies to patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and sm@@ el@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harm@@ less .
in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom was after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the whole European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adol@@ escents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should take place according to the previous illness process and can be termin@@ ated after the end of the symptoms and re@@ appear in their recur@@ rence .
in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that , in very rare cases , it can come to ben@@ di@@ ment that may lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the transport stability or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses given in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flu@@ gli@@ ding , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire regarding quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of eti@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be easily rec@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ ological treatment is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , apart from the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also leads to an improvement of the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pre@@ fer@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the sleep and w@@ ak@@ ef@@ ulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation following a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative difference in the tox@@ icity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can no longer be recognized for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience a higher substance strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a su@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adol@@ escents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and adol@@ escents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged 1 to 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ do@@ sis of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar to adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adol@@ escents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adol@@ escents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended doses of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ escents in clinical studies did not imp@@ air@@ ment the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ air@@ ment was neither increased to increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire regarding quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pre@@ fer@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which is restricted .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
12 different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable with pedi@@ at@@ ric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate must be removed without dam@@ aging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported daily in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were applied .
A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well toler@@ ated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended doses of 5 m@@ g. daily showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a 17 single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flu@@ gli@@ ding , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tray can be removed without dam@@ aging it .
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melt tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile provided in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Schmel@@ z@@ tabl@@ ette proved to be an equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sun for decre@@ asing des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .

in a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flu@@ gli@@ ding , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single @-@ dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ z@@ eng@@ ette with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 mg tablets have not been studied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ binding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the spread of this restricted met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no bio@@ equivalent study was needed and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable with pedi@@ at@@ ric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. formally informed the Committee on Human Use Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that should protect from a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus occurs , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have not yet established immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after the vacc@@ ine is administered , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vacc@@ ine as &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to establish antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this common type .
subsequently , the membrane h@@ ull of the virus was dis@@ connected with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a body ) , cleaned and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like further information regarding CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood that the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ ase after body weight is directed .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in blood while taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not to cure , however , can delay the immune system &apos;s harm and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults , previously used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with no det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alter@@ ation of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but the children , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r became a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals , which are degra@@ ded as well as A@@ gener@@ ase and are det@@ ri@@ mental in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years against the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee determined that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unusual circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ei@@ mer ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ st@@ erung of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disturb@@ ances to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function disturb@@ ance it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic beam and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver inci@@ dents with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with an existing h@@ epatitis show , including chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis show an increased frequency of h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ id substances , which are metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration .
for patients taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma samples from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ pedi@@ at@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to medications associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occur .
at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can develop , which leads to severe clinical condition or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eth@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the low plasma sugar by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver have been observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
when a patient receives John &apos;s Wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ st levels and , if possible , check the virus last and susp@@ end the cur@@ rants .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x by contrast by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that demonstrate the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % humili@@ ated if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice a day with calcium ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however , tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was conducted in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase differ at least one hour ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may possibly lo@@ wered the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is recommended since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma .
if these drugs are used together , caution is recommended ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as a detailed pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous offering of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma quality of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) on the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that can be listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can possibly lead to interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase .
the patients should therefore be monitored with toxic reactions which are associated with these pharmaceuticals when used in combination with a@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme indu@@ ctors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma bar of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers , such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine .
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plasma concentrations considerably and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ projec@@ tions in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol climb@@ ed around 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous offering of A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic kor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metaboli@@ zation is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , strong increases in plasma quality are expected while administr@@ ating a@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma simul@@ ations of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror is recommended as plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while ammon@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while it is advisable to take care with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am while applying simultaneous application .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicates a possible increase in the plasma of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the slight negli@@ gence of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s dose , when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given to meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
while offering war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic action ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predict@@ able , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk in humans .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the in@@ ni@@ sting to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast @-@ feeding during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of the offspring , including fertility and re@@ productive capacity , was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , performed early and rarely led to treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the adverse events mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ fer@@ ous patients received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of up @-@ to @-@ date laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and fatty tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull &apos;s neck ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study performed at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ eously within two weeks without having to break the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initi@@ ation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI previously treated patients , which received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception were elev@@ ations of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received very often in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient must observe the signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active Centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r are in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in the ab@@ normal cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r st@@ oo@@ ster@@ ile treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ y bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred until week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 included patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance samples that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 46@@ I , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors previously treated patients occurred in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based analyses gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ex @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with a increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ex @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a test test .
each of these four genetic samples related to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with which a Fos@@ amp@@ r@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI previously treated adults ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ence of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ su@@ ede threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.@@ 5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given simultaneously ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included in the study showed a plasma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .

after oral administration the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x by contrast by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake , although the simultaneous intake of food affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound ammon@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged .
while absolute concentration of non @-@ bound ammon@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 respectively show a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and a@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not re@@ plac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram@@ mb@@ ase .
also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dys@@ functions should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma mirrors comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers at a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on can@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , there were little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro gene tests , the bacterial report mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ icity may be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver tox@@ icity has been observed in patients , either during the administration of a@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic doses was observed in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If the A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be performed with care in patients with weak or light liver function disturb@@ ances , in patients with severe liver function disturb@@ ance it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be decreased in duration 27 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with it .
it has been shown that rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x by contrast by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice a day with calcium ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice a day .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however , tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
if these drugs are used together , caution is recommended ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as a detailed pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ projec@@ tions in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol climb@@ ed around 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
while offering war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic action ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fo@@ etus .

the anti@@ viral activity of AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in the ab@@ normal cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .

these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the met@@ abolic path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ei@@ mer ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in was not occupied either with PI previously treated patients or with PI previously treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to stop taking ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1,1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , there is no dose recommendation for simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided to avoid this combination in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in young children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive hibition of the metabolism of these pharmaceuticals and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhyth@@ ms ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk 47 of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occur .
it has been shown that rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x by contrast by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , there are significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us on the included Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk in humans .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the in@@ ni@@ sting to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during breast @-@ feeding during breast@@ feeding .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r st@@ oo@@ ster@@ ile treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ y bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
early abor@@ tion of a failure 60 treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data should be taken into consideration when using PI previously treated children for the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ar@@ gen@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large cou@@ pler volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic doses was observed in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .

the treatment frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week five times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , it is applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles to apply three times a week .
the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered on the affected skin surfaces before bed@@ time , so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before being washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving 505 patients with n@@ ac@@ ine ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the total healing rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 18 % of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a showed a full healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic actors ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the sc@@ alp for immun@@ o@@ competent adults when the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème is long to continue until all visible war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
in case of follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ der the cream until he / she noticed it and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area infected with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ p@@ ples until the cream is fully inserted .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .

in other studies , in which no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with one for circumcis@@ ion .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or have led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions were occurring at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which necess@@ itated a disaster cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous app@@ lic@@ ated methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripher@@ al region no clinical experience has yet to occur .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of inci@@ dence of inci@@ dence in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème has shown less effectiveness in this patient group concerning the elimination of gra@@ dients .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair attachment was not examined .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions are back after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s dis@@ comfort or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapies should be considered in super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experience , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip @-@ pot .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical locations outside the face and the sc@@ alp .
the available data on the sub@@ cut@@ aneous ker@@ at@@ oses on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème .
if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .

the most commonly shared and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in related side effects in trials with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ p@@ ples ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include complaints at the Application Location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the adverse events reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III are shown below .
the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context @-@ related side effect were in these studies a reaction at the Application Location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme are listed below .
these clinical signs designed according to the test plan show that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials involving three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème often occ@@ ured to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / leaves / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this evaluation of the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème it was very common in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring formation and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ker@@ at@@ ose ker@@ at@@ osis Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
acci@@ dental recognition of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing system@@ ic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it could be demonstrated that the efficacy regarding a complete recovery of the genital war@@ ts during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients were treated completely ; this was in 20 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo therapy ( 95 % CI :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically verified individual primary super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data contained in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 79.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for three weeks in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acc@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry sc@@ alp or in the face .
the results from two combined follow @-@ up studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two periods of treatment .
the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ p@@ ples , n@@ ude ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weigh@@ ed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the sc@@ alp ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the half @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to top@@ ical application was low to patients aged 6 to 12 and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ del@@ ine bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal tox@@ icity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements ag@@ grav@@ ate , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited met@@ abolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ation devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced the concentrations of G@@ AG in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion centre .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese hamster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or h@@ ep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alisation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the Phase 3 clinical trial , almost all patients have Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding res@@ ump@@ tion of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ tious .
treat 60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with drugs ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to minimize the potential inci@@ dence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider .
inf@@ usion can be res@@ umed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to not l@@ act@@ ate during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breath @-@ feeding and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 trial with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with a predominantly severe progression form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby it occ@@ ured at the age of 5 years with a severe progression form usually within a month to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) there were no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lacking until low antibody levels had a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the inci@@ dence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , although the occurrence of undes@@ irable drug reactions would typically coinci@@ de with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the treatment of enzyme is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of enzyme activity .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed out the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to perform in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is no significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size growing children .
from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG levels in the urine ( µg / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with respect to the hetero@@ geneous manifest@@ ations of the patient , which was taken into account by using a combined final point ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old phase 2 trial was conducted where the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe progression form and 4 with the mean progression form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development speed after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean progression form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas the older patients with severe progression form were only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosing regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule of 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available , assessed annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in a mal@@ ign@@ ant gift , tox@@ icity in repeated administration and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
since no clinical studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except for those mentioned in the 6th grade .

this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which ob@@ sol@@ ves certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
a inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side @-@ effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please tell your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously had previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens as sole treatment .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic drug ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and flu@@ ids should be given before or after cis@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) before or after cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , decreased or the dose should be decreased .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of activity in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study to 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived average 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta had longer life@@ times than with the compar@@ ative medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by the company Hel@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
each Pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see paragraph 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with well @-@ advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dosage of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the inci@@ dence and sever@@ ity of skin reactions it is necessary to be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid on the day before and on the day of the Sher@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mcg ) a week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after every third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each offering , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose test must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood diagram or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre@@ - h@@ ating therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 Blut@@ ung .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before the treatment
treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be broken down if in patients after 2 dose re@@ ductions a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so on at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age , there was an increased side @-@ efficiency risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data storage in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function ent@@ ang@@ lement of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bic boundary value and / or trans@@ am@@ inas@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) is not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to the bone @-@ brand supp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils reg@@ ain a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te @-@ number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ a@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity like neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was be@@ ached if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be used to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ tot@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy is provided , must avoid the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients receiving these events had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
for this reason , a drainage of the ergonom@@ ics before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation accumulation in trans@@ cellular space .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events have occasionally been reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versible damage to the re@@ productive capacity of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed consists , men should be advised in front of the treatment doctor , consult with regard to the sperm enhancement .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) lead to a reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is recommended if in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and minim@@ ally 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long semi @-@ life properties such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - x@@ ed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - res an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy , except if it is essential and after careful balancing of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ versible damage to the re@@ productive capacity of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed consists , men should be pointed out before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count .
it is not known if P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby can not be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and the random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , and 163 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

EM@@ PH@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin patients treated a clin@@ ically significant benefit of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to such patients who were gently attached with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was demonstrated in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single cis@@ pl@@ a tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were affected by improving the pul@@ mon@@ ary function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration in lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA for doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC obtained a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and 7.9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology to the overall survival in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC occurred in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a mainly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6.@@ 2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data of a separate random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of IT@@ T Pop@@ ulation and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the food , resulting in about a quarter of fats that are supplied with food uns@@ atur@@ ated the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo in 3@@ 91 patients .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took the All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg in taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed .
the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with step lab@@ s , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ st , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , decay o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( fa@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ bing syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the diges@@ tive tract ) or in cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited for placing or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK within the European Union .
All@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ve , low @-@ fat diet .
All@@ i must not be used by children and adol@@ escents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , as Or@@ list@@ at is only res@@ or@@ b@@ ated minimal , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Early treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Early treatment with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see paragraph 4.6 ) • Stop time ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single @-@ meal or low @-@ fat diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dose of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or higher cholesterol should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take extra pregnant measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with the simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and cil@@ los@@ por@@ in , a decrease in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
with the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international standard ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparation before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at simultaneously observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and depend on pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine , as absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data not estimated ) .
the frequency of reported side effects noted after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ le@@ mm@@ ings with regard to potential or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects such as the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported .
based on studies on humans and animals can be assumed from a rapid re@@ formation of any system@@ ic effects attri@@ but@@ able to the inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is applied in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ent binding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rema@@ inder of ga@@ stro and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ ae .
derived from clinical studies , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fat .
two double blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo controlled trials in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or , fet@@ al diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a variation of the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average cholesterol change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ est@@ erin amounted to 60 mg / 2.4 % ( initial value 5,20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in the L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3,30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( starting value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
during wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who were given a minimal system@@ ic res@@ or@@ ated dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) , were identified , representing nearly 42 % of the overall plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , kan@@ zer@@ ogen@@ ous potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .

for more useful information on the blue pages in section 6 , how to set your cal@@ orie targets and fat ?
if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work when the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat , you risk nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet .
nutritional hand@@ books are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits .
in order to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Take fat @-@ induced to reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not ac@@ custom@@ ed to physical activity . • St@@ ay while taking and after ending the intake of all@@ i physically active .
• all@@ i must not be taken for more than 6 months . if you can not observe any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of application of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • With a successful weight loss , it is not about switching off nutrition on short notice and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than an hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .

the most common side effects depend on the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment commen@@ ces , as you may not have reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional supplements : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat ev@@ enly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a high fat main dish or a cl@@ ums@@ y night table , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep up drugs for children in@@ accessible . • You may not apply any more to the exp@@ iry date stated on the cart@@ on . • Do not hold over 25 ° C. • The bottle holds two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ ag@@ el that serve to keep the capsules dry .

over@@ weight has influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart diseases • Impact • Cert@@ ain cancer diseases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ ak with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ jou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
what amount is appropriate for you , take note of the information below which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Due to the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to decline gradually and steadily .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can exercise daily 150 kcal per day , i.e. through 3 km walking , 30 - 45 minutes of garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and respect them . • Sinn@@ ful is a nutrition diary with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight collection combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fat du@@ ces and give guidelines to become physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the excessive cause of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi may be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the active substance is the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies to 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ gi@@ sts in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate cause of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ gi@@ sts in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission informed the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the whole European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to canc@@ er@@ ous disease and to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable when using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is prolonged or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five studied chemotherapy drugs ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pr@@ am@@ ides , an CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous offering of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 indu@@ ctors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ ob@@ eri@@ dol , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences of using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the doctor .
clinical trials were the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 mc@@ g. ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
similar inci@@ dents of adverse events were observed in the group with the highest dosage as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind trials , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life interval 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. in sing@@ ular doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
sor@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations , a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) generally are dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.0@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was observed at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total tex@@ tual position reached at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after a single @-@ use of 0.75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possess less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in vit@@ ro studies on metabolism , we have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , are involved in the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours of urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified ingredient made up about 40 % of the given dose .
following a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ etus for healthy eyel@@ ashes , the total body @-@ height was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver function interfer@@ es with the termin@@ ale elimination of the liver and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies effects were only observed after expos@@ ures that are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ ist exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 In pre @-@ clinical studies evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion@@ ary channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and prolong@@ ing the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose reported in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased inci@@ dence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ ines ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and because Alo@@ xi is intended for unique use in humans , the relevance of these results is very low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the failure of approval for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C was recommended for the treatment of the Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million I@@ U / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological agent named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in case of a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzymes al@@ an@@ in- am@@ amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood ab@@ normal .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon depos@@ ited data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study of h@@ epatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjustment of treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the CH@@ MP to the recommendation to fail the permit for placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be mark@@ eted is not sufficient .
the number of h@@ epatitis C patients responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to more patients than with the reference doctor ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question , to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been detected , or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin surface to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wound , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar responses : when the results of both studies were taken together at skin @-@ hours , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been noted that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled c@@ avi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections can out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by the European Commission , Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . , for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go on the whole of the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and consider alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ ti@@ zation or severe local irrit@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected spot occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached in humans for top@@ ical use on ne@@ eding skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After a simultaneous oral dose of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased to poor adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dosage adjustments are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity according to oral consumption and are insufficient in regards to a statement regarding the effects on birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding is continued or continued or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women should be considered .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most common reported side effect irrit@@ ation was at the place of administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin relies on sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding location of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ dungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer Center .
through binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appears question@@ able , advice should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ respon@@ ding to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
absorption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ cl@@ usion to intact and on s@@ atin skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary @-@ infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake on humans after top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 off skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily given by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with little involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in vit@@ ro screening on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rat micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosage of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ne@@ eding skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study of rats were determined in oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development tox@@ icity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity .

Ambi@@ rix is used for the protection against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between the age of 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ ani is used as a vacc@@ ine consisting of two doses , and a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ ani may only be used if there is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose against h@@ epatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ ani or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vacc@@ ine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ ani contains the same ingredients as the Twin@@ rix vacc@@ ine approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used for the protection against the same illnesses , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ine that exists from three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of using Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ ani resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ ani was similar to a six @-@ month intervals between the injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ ani ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ ani may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission informed the company Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ ani is made up of two doses of vacc@@ ine , whereby the first dose is given at the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ination is desired for h@@ epatitis B and h@@ epatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ine .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B antibodies observed after a pri@@ ming with the combination vacc@@ ine ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies lie in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured if immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed a h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ination need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vacc@@ ine .
if a quick protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standard vacc@@ ine is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies are under certain circumstances , so that in these cases the administration of other vacc@@ ines can be required .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impot@@ ence , these injection processes should be avoided .
however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturb@@ ances , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception , as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular contribution to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ure@@ - m@@ umps rub@@ ella vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ aul@@ ts , it must be assumed that insufficient immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the inci@@ dence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernity , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the inci@@ dence observed in the earlier Thi@@ astom@@ er and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ine doses Ambi@@ ani were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 ino@@ cul@@ ations at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per ino@@ cul@@ ation dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ ani at 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ dos@@ ed combination vacc@@ ine .
after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ ani were reported on pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 dos@@ - combination vacc@@ ine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ s was comparable to the overall vacc@@ ine ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects received , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) .
the inci@@ dence of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to that after administration of the combination vacc@@ ine was observed with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed vacc@@ ine regim@@ en .
in a compar@@ ative study with 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the inci@@ dence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per tape , was reported .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines reported via severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ ani or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine of 360 ELI@@ SA@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ated Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ine at the age of 1 up to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version rates for Anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ ani and 147 received the standard combined vacc@@ ine with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine .
the immune responses that have been achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with a combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of pri@@ ming between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vacc@@ ine .
the immune reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was similar to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine , compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ine .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ des with the immun@@ isation of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ converter rates as for previous formulation .
the vacc@@ ine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ p@@ ation by eye @-@ light on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the h@@ epatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow addi@@ ction ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ani cannot completely protect against infection with h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series was concluded with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B virus prior to the adoption of both vacc@@ doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick for the vacc@@ ine period ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent disease .
a protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ ani or any part of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) ?
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , breath or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . if you have an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
in case of a possible risk of h@@ epatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ani .
instead , he will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined h@@ epatitis B / h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced salary of effective components per vacc@@ ine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against ending the vacc@@ ine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / is or if you / your child undergo hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ ani can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 tell your doctor if you / your child take another medicine ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given / has been given / has been designed or planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate locations and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will nonetheless be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix request inform your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ A frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 c@@ anned ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at the entry level or red@@ ness • Mat@@ in@@ ability • irrit@@ ability • Head@@ ache • Appe@@ al short@@ age
♦ Normal ( up to 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) : • sw@@ elling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Pro@@ pi@@ dation • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
other side effects that occurred days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B very rarely ( less than 1 case per 10,000 consumed doses ) are :
these include local limited or extended r@@ ashes that may ju@@ g or be bl@@ ush , sw@@ elling of the eye area and the face , sm@@ elling breathing or swal@@ lo@@ wing , sudden blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned adverse events you / your child adver@@ sely affects or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP noted that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ani remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( by the nose in the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because Am@@ mon@@ ites could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a false drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , an ab@@ normal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , stomach ache , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ ash , r@@ ash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ ies in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ies was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unusual circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug was prescribed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 living days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect that is manifest@@ ed after the first month of life ) there is then an indication for use when an@@ am@@ n@@ esis consists of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy .
for babies , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient .
the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as in adol@@ escents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest@@ ed lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ pot@@ ion bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day is required .
ar@@ gin@@ ine deficiency in a dose of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders , as there is a risk of the origin of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ as if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet of AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is performed over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted to the mother &apos;s milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients were at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ azi@@ socket , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ag@@ ar@@ tery , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosage occurred at a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity during intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is eliminated by the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ ric acid can be produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest@@ o form of the disease with the on@@ set of the first symptoms in the new@@ born was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself was leading to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nit@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ pan@@ leu@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzyme with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary bladder dysfunction or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma in the next morning .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma arc were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and in adol@@ escents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest@@ ed lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ pot@@ ion bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day is required .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat p@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abolic of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , l@@ esi@@ ons occurred in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds cells of the brain bar@@ k .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ azi@@ socket , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ag@@ ar@@ tery , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess liquid
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ ric oxide .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible too , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ulate form , 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
during the period of durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spo@@ on contains 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if you are conducting laboratory tests , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding you are not allowed to use AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as the drug may go over into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturb@@ ances , dis@@ advantages of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disturb@@ ances and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for initi@@ ation of appropriate treatment .
when you forget the dose of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , impot@@ ence , ob@@ struction , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant r@@ ash , r@@ ash , ren@@ al dys@@ functions , weight gain and an@@ om@@ ale laboratory values .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , at un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest of different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) using He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients often used a St@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new happ@@ enings ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year overall as effectively as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective in relation to all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except in severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
an@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , other cer@@ ud@@ ine or other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ) in case of emergency interv@@ ene or if an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initial dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be added and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
an injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ade of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of them immediately subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ot@@ ted bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second draw of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ conduc@@ tive and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis can be administered quickly intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al dys@@ functions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ valve studies versus AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value lies under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis once again check .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al pain , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .

patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ valent is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
even though PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n perform most ble@@ edings on arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may undergo bleeding during the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent studies , monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ ative ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ valent studies reaches the level before treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of bi@@ valve studies with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are in any case regularly monitored .
in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development are insufficient ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years have more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in bi@@ valent studies than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ Dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ at@@ oma of ≥ 4 g / dl without apparent bleeding centre , reduction of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood allocation , which occ@@ ured at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study involving bi@@ valent studies in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .

the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed into table 6 according to system organ@@ elles .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira should immediately break off and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox includes Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at t@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is re@@ versible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part re@@ activ@@ ates the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
furthermore , bi@@ valent @-@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) could not indu@@ ce a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ valent @-@ udi@@ n shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was used in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5mg / kg should be given bi@@ valent and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study , frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in PCI .
in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk agents , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were ev@@ enly distributed over the three arms arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ escents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or as permanent inf@@ usion administered with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or unable to process insulin effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active life than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body no insulin can produce , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body insulin is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in the comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin injec@@ tions .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,30 % with human insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , thig@@ h or del@@ ta @-@ can or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdom@@ en .
because of decreased glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced .
any change of the effect , the brand ( manufacturers ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ ar@@ ded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method may undergo a change of insulin requirement .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change the treatment pattern .
substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disc@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fibro@@ my@@ ase , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ sis such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine may be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c antagon@@ regulation .
experimental studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity did not show any differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin sur@@ passes into human breast milk , but in general insulin enters neither the mother &apos;s milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed to oral use .

after a co@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar epis@@ odes .
insulin lo@@ wers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripher@@ al glucose ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the duration shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male subjects aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin lu@@ li@@ sin showed a dose proportional to the dose ranging from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast effect of action as normal human insulin and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cos@@ iness effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human insulin analog that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with a human insulin analog which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control as with human insulin analog insulin , which is given 2 minutes before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ ign@@ ant , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
