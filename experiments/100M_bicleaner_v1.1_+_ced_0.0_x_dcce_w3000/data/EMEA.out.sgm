<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR) which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assesses the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a psychic disorder in which the patients have manic episodes (periods anormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioral disorders if oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or smelting tablets in patients that make the swallowing of tablets trouble.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, as Abilify should be broken down, Abilify's dose should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol, like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, is less than the neurotransmitter to activate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies lasting up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused by increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder leading to increased restlessness, with which Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbates the melt tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness compared with the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevailed for up to 74 weeks than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidales disturbances (uncontrolled sugars), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), obstipation, nausea (increased memory production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episodes in patients who mainly spoke manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripiprazol compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission informed the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes and their manic episodes started to treat Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses above a 15 mg daily dose has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-indutor is removed from the combination therapy, the dose of Aripiprazol should be reduced to the recommended dose (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The incidence of suicide behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no higher risk of suicide with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transmission disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including akzelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms indicated on a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all anti-psychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">For this reason Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients suffering from seizures in anamnesis or at conditions associated with variccones.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study involving fixed dose, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes Mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as a side effect is known, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famprdin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically unrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism sufferers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV-proteasone inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, dosage should be raised from Abilify to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem (Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethhic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to insufficient data security in humans and because of the concerns raised in the animal's reproductive studies, this drug may not be used during pregnancy, unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned not to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinson's, athoms, dystonia and dyskinesia, occurred in patients treated with haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS increased 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol was 15.1% in patients suffering from eczzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I Disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, where potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occured, no medically significant differences occurred.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of the patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and about their incidence also reported in treatment with Aripiprazol, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes Mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, as Aripiprazl has a high plasma cut connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is transmitted over the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and to serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity to the dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine H1Rezeptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the administration of Aripiprazol in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, nucleus caudatus and at the putsch.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients, who retained a response to study medicine, was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of scales, defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery asberg- Depressionsrats scale, showed significantly greater improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher return rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Elanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which comprised 314 patients and in which the primary study 'weight gain' was, in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% was compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week Aripiprazol showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase more than 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole demonstrated against placebo based on the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and Hydroxylic of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolism robots via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism robots via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic study schizophrener patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any indication of clinically significant differences in regard to the ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharma kinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharma kinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the candidal potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions which have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-adrenal rinse toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulations and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3-fold mean Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazol in the Galle of monkeys after repeatable oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 82fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- aripiprazol were not more than 6% of concentrations found in the study of 30 mg. in the study, which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11fold mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injections solution is used for quick control of inanimity and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazol injections solution should be terminated and started with the oral use of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended in circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicine applied already for maintenance or acutely treatment (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazol is indicated, see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify Schmelztabletten, or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the effectiveness of Aripiprazol injections in patients with inanimity and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution is considered necessary, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injections are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal medicines).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transmission disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including akzelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmias).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as a side effect is known or an unhealthy lifestyle is observed and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazol, in a study in which healthy volunteers of Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) were used as intramuscularly and simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famprdin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically unrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In case of CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism sufferers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in comparison with CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV- protein-inhibitors, may have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, dosage should be raised from Abilify to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Aripiprazol.</seg>

<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, where potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occured, no medically significant differences occurred.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of the patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazol injectionsolution with statistically significant greater improvements of Agistrarities / behavioral disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as Agistreness and behavioural disturbances, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms in comparison with placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline value at the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients, who retained a response to study medicine, was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values of scales, defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg Depressionsrats scale, showed significantly greater improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a significantly higher return rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study enhancement in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole demonstrated against placebo based on the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% greater in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injections than tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The dose of Aripiprazol was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 or 5 times above the maximum humanist exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity according to intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humanist exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the candidal potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions which have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; in this way, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinse toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulations and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the 3-fold of the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazol in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times of the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose or the 16- to 81-fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was studied in a major study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated, of which about three quarters earlier had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or monotherapy) was compared with the medicine contained in a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, the main study was 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the medicines in relation to efficacy indicators such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood or have low neutrophils prior to the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that unlike other medicines, it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the transport of Abraxane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first-line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane treatment, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">At Sensory Neuropathie Level 3 the treatment is to be broken until an improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies were conducted with patients with impaired renal function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impairment of renal function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nano-articular formulation of paclitaxel that could have essentially other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="283">In patients no new Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils rise again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thrombocytes is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiovascular toxicity has not been proven, cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case of the patients after the gift of Abraxane nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, these can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constipative methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm enhancement, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible barrenness.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very often) and dizziness (common) that can affect the transport stability and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side-effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in trials (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1.000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burn, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose chair, esophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, headaches, pains, muscle spasms, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakening Very often:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules ingredient that promotes the merging of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their polymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital Interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the Transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the course of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumine receptor and occurs due to the albumbering protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two asymmetric unbanned studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second trial a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 Results for the overall response rate and time to progression free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay on Baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the Total-paclitaxel after 30 and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposition (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the paclitaxel plasma concentrations decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or consecration of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent-based paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane-Gabe (43%) than after a solvent-containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-diihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unchanged ingredient was 4% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients at the age of over 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and package insert. • With unique imaging of the correct application of the product provided cooling boxes for transport through the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological agent that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same drug (also referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values, in which a blood transfusion complication could occur if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be made by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be monitored before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which empowers them to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference medicine when administered as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of abseamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were changed to Abseamed were upheld in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) like sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the provisions of the European Union the evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company called Abseamed will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all Member States, including information about the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice Arzneimittel Pütter GmbH & Co KG to approve the transport of Abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of the transfusion requirement in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who received chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia during chemotherapy) consists.</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [6,2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger operating procedures affecting a large blood volume (4 or more units blood in men; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used in front of a large elective orthopedic intervention in adults without iron deficiency, where a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml are applied, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall health; therefore, the doctor is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of illness.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anaemia and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) might need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) might need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.E. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dosage increase of 25 I.E. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Angiomas and consequential effects may vary depending on age, sex and overall health; therefore, the doctor is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of illness.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required to control the Anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl to the initial value, the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">Compared to the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood consertions is required, Abseamed should receive body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the abseamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg free of epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection may be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with any erythropoetic at a erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a abseamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastopeny).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolilies).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopaedic intervention and which are not able to participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pros, coronary arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the Karotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopeny (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months to years with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effects, defined as reduction of the hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of non-responsive (ice, folate acid, or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminous toxication, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulozyte value, taking into account the anemia (i.e. the reticulozyte "index") is abnormal (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), thrombocytes and leukocytes are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow can be considered for a diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentrations in section 4.2 should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit which is attributable to the administration of epoeins when the hemoglobin concentration is increased via the concentration needed to control the angioma and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin rose should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinical evidence of coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients under chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should consider a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and the erythropoetin response (patients that need to be transubstantiated).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapies-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients envisaged for a greater elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, prior to the beginning of epoetin alfa drugs, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective orthopaedic procedure should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis as they have an increased risk of eroskeletal and vascular diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it can not be ruled out that for treatment with epoetin alfa, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may consist in treatment with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetines have not been proven that they improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">When epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindosis should be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial corals, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (brain bleeding, brain infarction), deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary arthromboses, aneurial thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, so also patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>

<seg id="573">The first study included nearly 8 000 older women with osteoporosis, and the number of spinal and hip fractures was investigated over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared six months with risedron (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for effectiveness was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood is again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies), the risk of fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients with placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subjected to the risk of kidney complaints, reactions to the infusion centre and osteoneksis (withering of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information material for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains instructions on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited for the placing of Aclasta in the whole European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages contain: • The package insert • contraindication in pregnancy and nursing women • Required of proper intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When using medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long mission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium, according to twice daily, at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.E. or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen briefly after applying Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is present.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data for harmlessness and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Before starting the treatment with Aclasta, an existing hypokalemia should be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Zoledron acid to the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium, according to twice daily, at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, bad oral hygiene, should be treated with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to the application of bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental surgery, no data is available whether the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen briefly after applying Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Cases of atrial fibrillation in cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1,3%) (51%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0,6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the total frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) of adverse drug effects are listed in chart 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney dysfunctions Zoledron acid was associated with renal dysfunctions associated with decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as active kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the Creatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited renal function were in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum-creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8% of the patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the morphine Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study aimed at avoiding clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Paget Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study aimed at avoiding clinical fractures following a recently suffered hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion point, such as redness, swelling, and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the jaw area have been treated, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecroses (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonate, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteoomyelitis, and the majority of the reports relates to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study of 7,736 patients showed osteonecrosis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Aclasta and placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be obtained by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The effectiveness and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the thigh stroke ≤ -2,5 with or without signs of an existing spine correction.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spine structure Aclasta shrank significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral structures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo-patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta proved a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in a reduction of 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) for hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebrate, hip and distal radius significantly compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the thigh neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology at 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken from the pelvic compound a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume in comparison with placebo and the maintenance of the trabecular bone structure.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.E. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD in total hip and thigh compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase in BMD by 5.4% in the overall fragrances and by 4.3% on the thigh neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show decreasing clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrate BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget des Knochens Aclasta was studied in patients at the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum level of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6 to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value when included in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of citron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg risedronate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six month trial could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response at 141 of the patients treated with Risedron could be maintained in an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosed independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">The plasma was then rapidly increasing &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long period of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid bipolar disappearance from the large circulation system with half-life times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the fast resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolic substances by Cytochrome-P450 is unlikely, because Zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the zoledron acid correlated with the creatine clearance, 75 ± 33% of the creatine clearance, and was in the mean 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction down to a creatine clearance down to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the zoledron acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe renal dysfunctions (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and 0,6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">Studies on dogs showed single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was given the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid in rats with a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 6ples of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC, corresponding to the 6jaw of human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC, equivalent to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in accumulated expositions, which sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common infection in trials with repeated application was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphor of long bones in animals during the growth phase with nearly all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats one observed teratogenicity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of decreased serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance class called bisphosphonates, and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens that are formed out of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget Morbus, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is constructed in an unordered way, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising the bone structure again, ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR) which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assesses the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) that can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl diurea or insulin, the current dose of sulfonyl resins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the account treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfonyl resins or insulin is to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonic acid, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3,5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered if the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of the additional offering of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl is decreased by 0.94%, while the addition of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients received actos in addition to insulin, lowering the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to Actos were visual dysfunctions, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and anesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirrors - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformwork is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing Actos in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "ACTOS" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients affected by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. past heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing developmental neurovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the reports of congestive heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymatic values are to be monitored as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, oversize, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker harn, the liver enzymatic values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical assessment up to the occurrence of laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain was detected, which may arise from fatty deposits and in some cases connected to a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3,6-4.2%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sulfonyl resin and insulin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyl resin or as a second combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the introduction of the market, the treatment with thiazolidindia, including pioglitazone, was reported on the appearance or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but decreasing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients communicate with visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or enter it, treatment is canceled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 indutor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone decreases in pregnancy resulting hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus diminishes the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (out of this data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a transient change in the turgor and the refraction of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT ascents across the triples of the upper limit of the normality range also often occur as placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylide.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease the frequency of severe congestive heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazon resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the introduction of the market it was rarely reported about congestive heart failure under Pioglitazon, but more frequently when it was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the Proactive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occured.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that pioglitazone reduces glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time to descend of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimisation with insulin were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was 0.45%, compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year at Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / creatinin quotients was observed in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as low, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone was reduced compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide, the total plasticity glycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant rise in the LDL Cholesterinspiegel was detected in Pioglitazon, while lower values were observed under metformin and gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both on the triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing developmental macrovascular disease were randomized in groups who received either a pioglitazone or placebo for over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the threefold of the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 indutor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Following oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the precipitation (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with limited renal function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the uterine decreases and thus diminishes the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidences of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) were induced by the urinary bladder.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindian resulted in increased incidence of colontes.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumine / creatinin ratio was observed in clinical studies over 1 year compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both on an effect on tryglyceride absorption as well as hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary Revascularization and Revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular risks are associated.</seg>

<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the placing of Actraphane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose adjustment has significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy may change hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, bipolar, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients for medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Sowell hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit death in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can cause unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disruptions of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system occasional - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement in blood glucose control can be associated with discomfort referred to as acute pain neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with a abrupt improvement in blood glucose adjustment can however be associated with a temporary degradation of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and the underbody tissue collateral - Lipodystrophy On the injection point can develop a lipodystrophy if failed to change the instichment within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the place of administration Yellow - Local over-sensitivity reactions in the injection centre During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma can occur at the injection point).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system occasional - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms generated hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic edema, breathing problems, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and impotence / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated with the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits, or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven help sperson or by glucose, which is intravenously given by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effect lasts up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of winding (hydrolysis) locations on the human insulin molecule have been considered; none of the metabolites formed by the splitting is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, to carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the acettraphane is taken out of the fridge - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is retired according to the instruction manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1175">In the first study 48% (126 of 262) of patients who took Adenuric at a dose of once daily 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) of the patients who took 120 mg once daily during the last three measurements showed a uric acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">This was compared with 22% (60 of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with heart problems in prehistory, there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side-effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricemia in diseases that have already led to primordial deposits (including one of the clinical history known or currently present) and / or arthritis.</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum acid level still amounts to 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks (357 µmol / l), dosage can be taken into account on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe renal function, efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated yet (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents Because there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the application of Febuxostat in this patient group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Since it has no experience in organ transplant receivers, the application of Febuxostat in this patient group is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">In patients with ischemic heart disease or self-compensated heart failure, the treatment with Febu ostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnesionous medicines, it can come to an acute attack during treatment due to the reduction of the serum-harshouse-piegels at first brute acid deposits in the tissue can be mobilised.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in malignant diseases and their treatment, Leschi Nyhan's syndrome, the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical studies, slight changes of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Feb. ostat (3,5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of February treatment and in the subsequent course (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwart did not have any intra-effect studies to Feb. ostat, but it is known that the XO-hibition can lead to an increase in theophyll-mirror (an inhibiting of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">The simultaneous offering of Febuxostat and Naproxen 250 mg 2 times was associated with an increase in February exposure exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in undesirable events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dosage adjustment for Febuxostat or at the same time required other active substance.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily showed a mean 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, an CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be demonstrated that the simultaneous intake of an antacid, the magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide contains, the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) delayed and a decrease in the CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exponed pregnancies can not be concluded on the side effects of February at the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC is not detrimental to its performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall febukinol group in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0,3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Feb. ostat could be found.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse events reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Febuxostat and which were reported in all Feb. ostat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with colchicin. * * In clinical studies no heavy rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies in the open long term extension studies were treated 906 patients for up to 1 year, 322 patients for up to 2 years, 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with Feb. ostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Treatment-related events reported during long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febroostat treatment groups more than once and occured in patients who received February uxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the information occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleeplessness, hypaesthesia, eye-catching ECG, coughing, shortness, skin inflammations, lesions, congestion, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in the concentration of the lymphocytes, decline in the number of white blood cells.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies in phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in every study the proportion of patients receiving the last three monthly serum acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum secretion value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed a statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Allopurinol 300 mg every day.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum secretion (1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were summarized for analysis. * p &lt; 0,001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0,001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">Reducing the level of serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed in week 2 at the doctor's visit and kept permanently throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum secretion &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal dysfunctions The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with renal function restriction (i.e. h).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg. 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg. 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily).</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of the serum acid concentrations in subjects, regardless of their renal function (58% in group with normal renal function and 55% in group with severe renal dysfunctions).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum-acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl, about 40% of the patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a replenishment).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction of the gout node size, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the gout nodes by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µU / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febu ostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration period curve (AUC) of February after administration were easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase of AUC is observed for February at February, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg. 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to approximately 2.8-3,2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed, if this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent Steady-state distribution volume (Vpp / F) from Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The microscope binding of Febuxostat amounts to about 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid primarily occurs through UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged Febuxostat (3%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (30%), its well known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair found itself as an unchanged Febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Specific patient groups renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC from Febuxostat increased about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh-Klassifikation B) or moderate (Child-Pugh-Klassifikation B), the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you keep the acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the formation of the crystals is prevented and thus achieved with time a reduction of the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC may not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the agent Febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Inform your doctor before you start taking this medication, if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem. if you are treated with a high uric acid concentration following a cancerary disease or the Lesch-Nyhan-Syndroms (a rare congenital disorder in which too much uric acid in the blood is found).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a gout attack at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, heat and joint swelling), wait until the gout attack is cleared before you begin with the treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be with everyone, but could also occur with you, especially during the first treatment weeks or - months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent a seizure attack or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is especially important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use drugs that may appear in the following substances as interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor might want to consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurin (for the treatment of cancer) • Theophylline (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been carried out on the effects of ADENURIC on the transport stability and the ability to serve machines.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid a irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As Alendronat and vitamin D3 can already be used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the Company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low-vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those used exclusively Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also stipulates that the Alendronat dose of ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of digestive apparatuses such as stomach pain, dyspepsy (diarrhoea), ulcers (ulcera), ulcers, dysphagia (swallowing), ascending abdomen (blocked abdomen) as well as acires.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any other constituent components ADROVANCE may not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used in case of diseases of esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1285">In January 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. for the transport of ADROVANCE throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Capsular, white to broken white tablets, labeled with the outline of a bone on one side and "710" on the other side.</seg>
<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE is available only with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, beverage or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • The patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulceration. • The patients should not take place before the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulceration and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronate (sometimes these were severe and required a hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of viesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine and seek medical advice (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that indicate esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">During large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no higher risk was detected, rare (after market introduction) gastric and duodenal ulceroses, among them some serious and with complications, have been reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoneksis of the jaw, commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteoomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment was mainly intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available to indicate whether the risk of a bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a jaw-surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteonecsis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the attending physician is authoritative for the treatment planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be advised to take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after having noticed their omisition.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets on the same day, but take the dose of one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendron no indication of direct foaming effects with regard to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoneksis of the jaw was reported in patients under bisphosphonates; most of the reports come from cancer patients, but also osteoporosis patients were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, decreases of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2,0 mmol / l) and serum phosphats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occur in both treatment groups with similar incidence.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Alendronat of oral overdose can occur hypocalcemia, hypophosphoremia and side effects in the upper Gastrointestinal tract like stomach upset, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis or ulceral.</seg>

<seg id="1402">As Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already used in the EU, the company has presented the results of previously completed trials with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from the published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, whereby the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a year of treatment (for example investigated how often a new organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant have been conducted and analysed how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; changing the formulation or regime should only be conducted under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">Following a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in the individual case and on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus tallow levels should be checked before conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, the adjustment of Advagraf can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">The duration of the application During the suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendation - renal transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should begin at 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization following transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - Liver Transplantation Prophylaxis of Transplantation Cancellation The oral Advagraf therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules at once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to be done in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg).</seg>
<seg id="1425">Renal and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to advagraf once a day, treatment with the oral initialdosis recommended in renal and liver transplants must begin daily for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Transplantation In case of adult patients who are transplanted to advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other graft receivers Obwohl there is no clinical experience with advagraf in lungen-, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, in pancreatic transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood-talons in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it may be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of serum cancers, a calculation of the creatine and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level of the blood in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in an individual case under the aid of whole blood tacrolimus levels.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent inspections of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the bottom level in the blood exceeds 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the tallow level of tacrolimus in the thoroughbred in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and arenal - and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplant reactions or other side effects, which may occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus sub- or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; changing the formulation or regime should only be done under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has proven to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data is available for the retardant formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant receivers and graft receivers in childhood are not yet available in clinical data for the retardant formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effectiveness of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing currants (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is offered, as the tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or Septumhypertrophy described as Kardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin lesions due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking the Tacrolimus symptoms for PRES like headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and vision disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g) should show.</seg>
<seg id="1449">As Advagraf hard capsules, retardiert, lactose contain, special care is required in patients with rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus increase or lower blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose for maintaining even concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimycotics like ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole, as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies have resulted in the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus caused by inhibiting gastrointestinal fluids.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolon, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism is impaired.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the exposure of hormonal exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially decrease the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong its half-value.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of investigations on transplant patients have no indication that in comparison with other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events regarding the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Utero exposure is recommended to monitor the newborn to any harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hyperkalianaemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases As is known to other highly effective immunosuppressants, patients who are treated with tacrolimus have often increased susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of Virus-Virus-associated Nephropathy and JC-Virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuppressive therapy, including therapy with advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasties including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative disease and skin tumours associated with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Effect mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to convey the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosolian protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enriching the connection within the cellular nuclei.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction problems in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphoma genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on the T cells, further the formation of lymphokins (such as interleukin-2, interleukin 3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to the observations in the large studies in which Prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multi-centric study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome was less frequent in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">Survival rate after a year was 80.8% in the tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus patients were in 21.7% of cases for the emergence of bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was higher after 6 months (57,7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the action-transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multi-centric study conducted with oral prograf was performed to 205 patients receiving pancreatic and kidney transplantation following a randomised trial of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral Initialdosis (via protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired level of 8 to 15 ng / ml per 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplantation showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone margins, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to levels between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently graft radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematomas and low protein concentrations, leading to an increase in the fractionated fraction of tacrolimus, or a reinforcement of metabolic induced by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearing-rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) on Advagraf (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose, the systemic exposition of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximate 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended frequent inspections of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data is available for the retardant formulation of Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (caused by lack of factor VIII, congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advances are applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleedings in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but manufactured according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling them to form the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Recombinate, but it is manufactured differently so that the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septic periods with "excellent" or "good" evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advata (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advata may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human gerinnation factor VIII, mouse or hamsterprotein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the Factor VIII-activity should not fall below the specified concentrations of plasma (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections an appropriate determination of the Factor VIII concentration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleedings in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosage speed is to be directed according to the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the Prokoagulation activity of Factor VIII. IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously untreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 repositionists and anamnestically well-known Inhibitory Development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (lower) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs experienced in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP has decided on the basis of the ADVATE safety profile, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the registrant should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee on Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) officially that the company resumes its application for the transfer of advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that bind other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been modified in such a way that no copies of itself can be produced and thus no infection can trigger people.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumours and thus enable cancer cells to reconstitute the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made from the p53 gene existing in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Wimeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, with the Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the area of the underbody, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the answers of the company to the questions presented to him, some questions were still unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the documents submitted, CHMP creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advancing can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company does not know the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of nasal pathways) in patients with nasal mucal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents from the age of 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food completely with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are depleted.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When examining all hay-fever symptoms, the patients who took the aerate, reported a decrease in the symptoms of 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who took Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), oral dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), anorexia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any other component, against adrenergic agents or lauatadine (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hyperthyroid), hyperthyroidissis (hyperthyroid stroke) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">"" "" "" "on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit issued by the European Commission for the transport of aerobatics throughout the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without crushing, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerobics should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the absence of data to harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after blades of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as for long-term use the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, treatment can be continued as monotherapy if required.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after finishing such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity associated with combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, liurid, cabergoline, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deconjunctiva, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, napracolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient body and the data does not suffice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerobics were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data does not suffice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, hydatid sobstruktion or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is available at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo independent of whether desloratadine alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Disloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerate during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerobics should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that, in very rare cases, it can lead to a dizzlement that can lead to impairment of the transport stability or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collaps) and a ZNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible lethal cursions.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, difficult micro, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heartbeat, ppitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preoperative pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-drying, pupil rigidity and - dilation, skin troughness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose trial with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flugliding, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended doses of 5 mg. daily showed no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 years participated in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerobacic tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine effectiveness of aerate tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall cores for symptoms (except nasal skin swelling), significantly higher than under monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerate tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal skin swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerate tablets did not show significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of an individual dose study on pharmacokinetics of aerate, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow equilibrium of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine reached day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects desloratadine poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to exposure after the gift of an aerate tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadine does not reveal any special hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of lauatadine / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmacovigilance system described in module 1.8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviate the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerate tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and watering or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases may occur or diagnosed with you under the application of Aerinaze: • high blood pressure • heart chase, heart palpitations • Heart rhythms • nausea and headaches or strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking aerobites with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">The use in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that Aerinaze leads to dizziness or decreases the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerobize than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aeroze than you should.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadine, very rarely reported cases of severe allergic reactions (airnot, whistling breathing, itching, nettle rash and swelling) or rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chase, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disorders, muscular pain, varicose cases, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver values was also very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 Mg- Lyophiliskate (soluble tablet), 2.5 Mg- and 5 mg-melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by determining the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for taking and smelting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in urticaria, the decrease of the symptom was after six weeks treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, loratadine or other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aerius in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of desloratadine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should take place according to the previous illness process and can be terminated after the end of the symptoms and reappear in their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), patients can be recommended during the allergy time.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving Desloratadine tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking aserius and alcohol, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not amplified (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that, in very rare cases, it can come to bendiment that may lead to impairment of the transport stability or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), oral dry (0.8%) and headaches (0,6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadine and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical trial with multiple doses given in the desloratadine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flugliding, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as Niesen, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall cores of the questionnaire regarding quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology regardless of etiology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histological treatment is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that Desloratadine, apart from the chronic idiopathic urticaria, also leads to an improvement of the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Preferitus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine compared to 19% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, where patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population were comparable, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant accumulation following a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadine and Loratadine showed no qualitative or quantitative difference in the toxicity profile of Desloratadine and Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desloratadine can no longer be recognized for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis are caused by infection in children under 2 years (see section 4.4) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadine and experience a higher substance strain (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolise normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose-absorption or a sucharase-isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not amplified (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup Group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study on adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine times clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged 1 to 11 who were eligible for antihistamine therapy received a daily disloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadine are similar to adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadine in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the desloratadine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study on adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied for over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>

<seg id="1781">In adults and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall cores of the questionnaire regarding quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Preferitus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolic phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which is restricted.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. formally informed the Committee on Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the transport of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus occurs, which can easily spread from man to person, because humans have not yet established immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "body-alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to establish antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this common type.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane hull of the virus was disconnected with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a body), cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like further information regarding CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to take, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined what antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agenerase after body weight is directed.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the HIV-amount in blood while taking in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not to cure, however, can delay the immune system's harm and thus also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dosed Ritonavir increased medicine Agenerase was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults, previously used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with no detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also decreased the viral load, but the children, who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the viral load of Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase together with Ritonavir became a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase should not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are degraded as well as Agenerase and are detrimental in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase are the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteoneksis (death of bone tissue) or an immune response syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the rejuvenating immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in use in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic ritonavir, but the committee determined that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not take protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "unusual circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit issued by the company Glaxo Group Limited for the transport of Agenerase in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, proteaseimer (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Generally, Agenerase capsules are to be administered to the pharmacokinetic boosterung of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than by Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing additive of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Agenerase's pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data for harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disturbances to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function, in patients with severe liver function disturbance it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic beam and also present substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver incidents with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with an existing hepatitis show, including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of hepatic dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous application of Agenerase and ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoid substances, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalised ratio), methods are available to determine the substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma samples from Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolgehalts of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an expediatation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases related to medications associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous hematomas and hemorrhages occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop, which leads to severe clinical condition or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial ethology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoneclipsis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that rifampicin causes 82% reduction of the AUC by Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the low plasma sugar by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with currants (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient receives John's Wort, the amprenavirst levels and, if possible, check the virus last and suspend the currants.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nelfinavir is given together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for CMAx by contrast by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amprenavir were used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily that demonstrate the effectiveness and harmlessness of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliated if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were reached twice a day with calcium (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir is administered twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given; however, tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was conducted in combination with didanosine, but due to the antacid component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase differ at least one hour (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may possibly lowered the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used at the same time, caution is recommended since Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is recommended; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as a detailed prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous offering of Amprenavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with agenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma quality of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) on the 2.69fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that can be listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can possibly lead to interactions with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored with toxic reactions which are associated with these pharmaceuticals when used in combination with agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase as it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir may lead to a degradation of the plasma bar of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with Agenerase can increase its plasma concentrations considerably and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side-effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg of fluticasonprojections intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol climbed around 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous offering of Agenerase with ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic korticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In case of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolization is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, strong increases in plasma quality are expected while administrating agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma simulations of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhubdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror is recommended as plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased while ammonavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with oral midazolam (see section 4.3) while it is advisable to take care with parenteral Midazolam while applying simultaneous application.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicates a possible increase in the plasma of Midazolam by 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the slight negligence of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, such as amprenavir's dose, when Amprenavir is given to methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">While offering warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening antithrombotic action (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may be used only after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, Amprenavir-related substances were proven, however, it is not known whether Amprenavir passes into the mother's milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the innisting to the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period Amprenavir showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during breast-feeding during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not impaired by the administration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, performed early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenerase or another medicine applied at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with proteasferous patients received 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication, were performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of up-to-date laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fatty tissue, increased intraabdominals and visceral tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated individuals who had been treated with Amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (bull's neck) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study performed at 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and appeared usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to break the treatment with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoneksis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI previously treated patients, which received 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily along with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception were elevations of triglyceride and CPK values, which received very often in patients who received Agenerase along with low dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient must observe the signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active Centre of HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein stages with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of AMprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibit concentrations (IC50) of Amprenavir are in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in the abnormal cells and is 0.41 µM for chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir stoosterile treatment schemes with proteaseiny bitors - the described mutations are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not pre-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred until week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 included patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance samples that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M46I, D60E, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibitors previously treated patients occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">On genotypic resistance tests based analyses genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasex-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with a increased phenotypic resistance to ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance tests based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with genotypic data for estimating the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasex-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic Cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a test test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples related to Amprenavir's associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir Resistenzpfade, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients with which a Fosampravir (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasor-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits which can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which PI previously treated adults (600 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard care (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the sub-study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis demonstrated the non-subsistence of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the time-adjusted average change from baseline value (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-suede threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the effectiveness of unbundled Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 had been treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed Ritonavir was given simultaneously; the majority of the patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients included in the study showed a plasma HIV-1-RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for CMAx by contrast by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake, although the simultaneous intake of food affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound ammonavir, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of non-bound ammonavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the overall drug concentration in the Steady-State via the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 respectively show a substrate of CYP3A4, must be administered with caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and agenase capsules are not replaceable on a milligrammbase.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearing of Ritonavir is negligible, so the effect of renal dysfunctions should be low on the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amponavir plasma mirrors comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers at a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on canogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas occured in male animals, which corresponded to the 2,0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was not yet elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there were little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro gene tests, the bacterial report mutation test (Ames test), mouse lymphoma test, microcore test of rats and chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>

<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity has been observed in patients, either during the administration of agenerase after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the animals and the animals treated with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly below (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure under therapeutic doses was observed in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If the Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing additive of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be performed with care in patients with weak or light liver function disturbances, in patients with severe liver function disturbance it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were reached twice a day with calcium (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir is administered twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given; however, tight monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is recommended; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as a detailed prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with agenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg of fluticasonprojections intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol climbed around 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">While offering warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening antithrombotic action (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin by Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2190">In other studies, in which no daily Vorhauthygiene was performed, two cases of severe phimosis and one case were observed with one for circumcision.</seg>
<seg id="2191">With an application of Imiquimod crème in higher than the recommended doses, there is increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local skin irritations were observed, which made a treatment necessary and / or have led to a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions were occurring at the outcome of the urethra, some women had trouble passing urine, which necessitated a disaster catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">For the application of Imiquimod crème immediately following a treatment with other cutaneous applicated methods for the treatment of external genital warts in the genital and peripheral region no clinical experience has yet to occur.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data suggest an increased rate of incidence of incidence in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod crème has shown less effectiveness in this patient group concerning the elimination of gradients.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of the basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimodine within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hair attachment was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions are back after completion of treatment with Imiquimod crème.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or because of the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">There are currently no data on long-term treatment rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable therapies should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs there are no clinical experience, so the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Iodquimod was not examined for treatment of acute keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip-pot.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data about the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratoses in anatomical locations outside the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the subcutaneous keratoses on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod crème.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 ac- lesions showed a lower healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and as likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream in related side effects in trials with three-week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of feignipples (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod cream in the related side effects include complaints at the Application Location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The adverse events reported by 185 with Imiquimod-Creme from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as likely or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream in the context-related side effect were in these studies a reaction at the Application Location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies of phase III with Imiquimod-Creme are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">These clinical signs designed according to the test plan show that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials involving three-week treatment with Imiquimod crème often occured to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), exkoriation / leaves / shed (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This evaluation of the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with Imiquimod crème it was very common in these studies with Imiquimod crème (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scarring formation and cabling (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of the keratose keratosis Alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Accidental recognition of 200 mg Imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha-interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical use of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it could be demonstrated that the efficacy regarding a complete recovery of the genital warts during an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients with Imiquimod treated patients were treated completely; this was in 20% of the patients treated with placebo therapy (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod for five-time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically verified individual primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data contained in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine for three weeks in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">The patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic acc- lesions within a related 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The results from two combined follow-up studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two periods of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external feignipples, nude keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod crème by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three-week weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the half-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod to topical application was low to patients aged 6 to 12 and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute keratose or superfideline basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study conducted for the dermal application for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumors to the application center.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod only has a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for man is to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors performed in the group of mice treated with the real-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme reduced the concentrations of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion centre.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of pulmonary function), speedycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be highly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other ingredients (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>

<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovvary, ovarian of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient has this to be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or hepatic insufficiency was not determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where revitalisation facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the Phase 3 clinical trial, almost all patients have IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions have to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding resumption of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of treatment must be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the start of infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyreagents) to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to consider.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine, because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular intake of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended to not lactate during treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breath-feeding and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase- 2 trial with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with a predominantly severe progression form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment to a seroconversion, whereby it occured at the age of 5 years with a severe progression form usually within a month to a seroconversion (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 trial (or up to a premature departure from the study) there were no detectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients, among them 3 patients with whom it never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacking until low antibody levels had a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG was detected in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro which seemed to not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, although the occurrence of undesirable drug reactions would typically coincide with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the treatment of enzyme is one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and only one patient pointed out the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme each week (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to perform in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is no significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased further proportionally to the body size growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the GAG levels in the urine (µg / mg of creatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With respect to the heterogeneous manifestations of the patient, which was taken into account by using a combined final point (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old phase 2 trial was conducted where the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe progression form and 4 with the mean progression form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- mirror in urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) found a normal mental development speed after the Z-Score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean progression form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas the older patients with severe progression form were only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyms dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule of 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available, assessed annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously had previously received other chemotherapy regimens as sole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "antiemetic drug (drug against vomiting) and fluids should be given before or after cisplatin (to prevent fluid deficiency) before or after cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood-image changes or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, decreased or the dose should be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of activity in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study to 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin survived average 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta had longer lifetimes than with the comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit issued by the company Heli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each Piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see paragraph 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with well-advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dosage of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions it is necessary to be given a corticosteroid on the day before and on the day of the Sheremetrexed gift.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) a week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each offering, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate-transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose test must take place taking into account the Nadir of the blood diagram or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the pre- hating therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are to be used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 Blutung.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ level 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted by ALIMTA until the patient has the value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be broken down if in patients after 2 dose reductions a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so on at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age, there was an increased side-efficiency risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harmlessness and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data storage in patients with a creatine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function entanglement of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubic boundary value and / or transaminasenvalues of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) is not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to the bone-brand suppression and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils regain a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte-number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and nichthaatological toxicity like neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was beached if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistics (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cytotic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a Pemetrexed therapy is provided, must avoid the intake of NSAIDs with long half-value for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients receiving these events had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For this reason, a drainage of the ergonomics before the Pemetrexed treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant hydration accumulation in transcellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events have occasionally been reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity of Pemetrexed consists, men should be advised in front of the treatment doctor, consult with regard to the sperm enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistics (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1,3 g daily) lead to a reduced Pemetrexed excretion with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is recommended if in patients with normal renal function (creatinin-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are applied in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, be avoided on the day of therapy and minimally 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long semi-life properties such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Normalised ratio) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- res antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy, except if it is essential and after careful balancing of the use for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity of Pemetrexed consists, men should be pointed out before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known if Pemetrexed passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby can not be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalve, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, as Orlistat is only resorbated minimal, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Early treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Early treatment with ciclosporin (see paragraph 4.6) • Stop time (see section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a low-fat single-meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dose of the antidiabetic needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or higher cholesterol should consult their physician or pharmacist whether the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take extra pregnant measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with the simultaneous application of orlistat and cillosporin, a decrease in Ciclosporin plasma was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">With the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international standard ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplementary multivitamin preparation before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single dose Amiodaron, a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat simultaneously observed a minor decrease in the Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on pharmacological effects of the medicine, as absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on the available data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported side effects noted after the market launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to deflemmings with regard to potential or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases of orlistat overdosage reported after the market launch, either side effects or similar side effects such as the recommended dose of orlistat were reported.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals can be assumed from a rapid reformation of any systemic effects attributable to the inhibitory properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is applied in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by kovalent binding to the active serine-remainder of gastro and pancreatic lipasae.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Derived from clinical studies, 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of about 25% of the food-fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trials in adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalor, fetal diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of the randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a variation of the body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average cholesterol change in the Gesamtcholesterin amounted to 60 mg / 2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (starting value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in the LDL Cholesterins was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (starting value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">During waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg Orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolic orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who were given a minimal systemic resorated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl-Leucine group), were identified, representing nearly 42% of the overall plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnsty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable when using Palonosetron with medicines that prolong the QT interval or in patients with whom the Qt interval is prolonged or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five studied chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose Palonosetron and a Steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramides, an CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous offering of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodaron, Celecoxib, Chloroberidol, Paroxetine, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences of using Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 mcg. (altogether 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">Similar incidents of adverse events were observed in the group with the highest dosage as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy for Aloxi- overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind trials, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg Dolasetron (half-life interval 7.3 hours) were given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical examinations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ionic channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of I.V. in singular doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Sorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations, a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) generally are dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.03- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous dose of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was observed at 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the total textual position reached at once daily intravenous intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to the value measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after a single-use of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron possess less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism, we have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lesser degree, are involved in the metabolism of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron as an unmodified ingredient made up about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a one-time intravenous boletus for healthy eyelashes, the total body-height was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver function interferes with the terminale elimination of the liver and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies effects were only observed after exposures that are considered adequate above the maximum humanist exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 In pre-clinical studies evidence that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ionary channels, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolonging the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose reported in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pankreas, adrenreas, adrenal marines) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and because Aloxi is intended for unique use in humans, the relevance of these results is very low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the failure of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of the Alpheon 6 million IU / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological agent named Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In case of a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzymes alanin- amaminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood abnormal.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates it to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon deposited data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjustment of treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the CHMP to the recommendation to fail the permit for placing on the market?</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was reluctant to more patients than with the reference doctor; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the question, to what extent the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crusts) and small infected Lazerations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been detected, or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the skin surface to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was deciphered after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wound, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar responses: when the results of both studies were taken together at skin-hours, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been noted that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo on the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections can outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit issued by the European Commission, Glaxo Group Ltd., for the placing of Altargo on the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and consider alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation through the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to be used to treat infections where MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary open wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been reached in humans for topical use on needing skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant hibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After a simultaneous oral dose of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased to poor adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosage adjustments are not required if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity according to oral consumption and are insufficient in regards to a statement regarding the effects on birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding is continued or continued or the treatment with Altargo should be continued, the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the altargo applied, the most common reported side effect irritation was at the place of administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin relies on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding location of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding stelle ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransfer Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits Peptidyltransfer, block partial P binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of reapamulin at least some infection forms appears questionable, advice should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolate were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-responding to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on satin skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary-infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical use of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 off skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily given by CYP3A4, with little involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro screening on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat microcore test for in-vivo analysis chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosage of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, making up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 needing skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats were determined in oral dosage of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted to the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">To show irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area, you should quit the use of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointment, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless it was specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment comes from sewing to one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between the age of 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambiani is used as a vaccine consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambiani may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and is ensured that the vaccination plan can be completed from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambiani or another Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines act by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the natural defense of the body)" "" "as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambiani contains the same ingredients as the Twinrix vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used for the protection against the same illnesses, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccine that exists from three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of using Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children, which had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambiani resulted in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambiani was similar to a six-month intervals between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambiani (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambiani may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substances, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission informed the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambiani is made up of two doses of vaccine, whereby the first dose is given at the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a hepatitis B vaccination is desired for hepatitis B and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B antibodies observed after a priming with the combination vaccine (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies lie in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured if immunocompetent individuals who have addressed a hepatitis B vaccination need a refresher vaccination as they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies are under certain circumstances, so that in these cases the administration of other vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal impotence, these injection processes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambirix can be injected as an exception, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular contribution to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measure- mumps rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defaults, it must be assumed that insufficient immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the incidence observed in the earlier Thiastomer and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses Ambiani were administered to a total of 1027 inoculations at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per inoculation dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambiani at 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a dose of 3-dosed combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inoculation cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who received Ambiani were reported on pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects vaccinated with the 3 dos- combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of mats was comparable to the overall vaccine (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects received, compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to that after administration of the combination vaccine was observed with the 3-dosed vaccine regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dosed combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per tape, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines reported via severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambiani or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine of 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinated Hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccine at the age of 1 up to including 15 years, the seroconversions rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The SeroConversion rates for Anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambiani and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was valuable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses that have been achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations received either a 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of priming between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hepatitis antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction observed in this study against both antigens was similar to that after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccine, compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life coincides with the immunisation of a combined Diphtheria-, Tetanus-, acellular Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconverter rates as for previous formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (yellow addiction) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambiani cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete inoculation series was concluded with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the adoption of both vaccdoses (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick for the vaccine period), vaccination may not prevent disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambiani or any part of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic)?</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itchy skin rashes, breath or swelling of the face or tongue. if you have an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambiani.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective components per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection against ending the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected to persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / is or if you / your child undergo hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambiani can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 tell your doctor if you / your child take another medicine (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated recently / has been given / has been given / has been designed or planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate locations and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since issuance of the first permit for placing on the market, the CHMP noted that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambiani remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only brought into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nasal probe (by the nose in the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonites could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a false drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, an abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headaches, impotence, fluid retention, stomach ache, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The CHMP's Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Ammonies in patients with disruptions of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonies was approved in" "" "unusual circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug was prescribed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 living days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifested form (incomplete enzyme defect that is manifested after the first month of life) there is then an indication for use when anamnesis consists of hyperammonia encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early-manifested lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithinpotion bamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day is required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Arginine deficiency in a dose of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk of the origin of esophagus ulceras if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet of AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate is performed over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous use of phenylacetate at young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed ripening of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted to the mother's milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients were at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactazisocket, severe hypokalemia, agartery, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosage occurred at a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity during intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that conjugated with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is eliminated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitric acid can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifesto form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in the newborn was almost always infested, and the disease itself was leading to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitric excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifested form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithinpanleuylase deficiency), which were treated with a hyperammonia encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is jugated in liver and kidney enzyme with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous injection of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after the intake of measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary bladder dysfunction or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) showed no phenylacetate in plasma in the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma arc were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no clastogenic effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a Gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">The normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early-manifested lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithinpotion bamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day is required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat putes were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolic of phenylbutyrat), lesions occurred in the pyramids cells of the brain bark.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactazisocket, severe hypokalemia, agartery, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess liquid</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disruptions of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitric oxide.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible too, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form, 15 minutes after the intake of measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example, at unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest of different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (an anomal measured value of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow in patients with angina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) using Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often used a Stent (a short tube, which remains in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - was as effective in preventing new happenings (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year overall as effectively as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was equally effective in relation to all indicators as Heparin, except in severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other cerudine or other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the transport of Angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-lift infarction) in case of emergency intervene or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be added and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolusade of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of them immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allotted bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second draw of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconductive and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolusdosis can be administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal dysfunctions (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalve studies versus ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value lies under 225 seconds, a second bolusdosis of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolusdosis once again check.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal pain, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe renal damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after end of intravenous administration of unfractional Heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecule leparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other constituent or against cerudine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bivalent is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though PCI patients under Bivalirudin perform most bleedings on arterial puncture points, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may undergo bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with bivalent studies, monitoring of the INR-Werts (International normative ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bivalent studies reaches the level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombocytes aggregationshemmer) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalve studies with thrombocyte aggregates or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are in any case regularly monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalira alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractional Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years have more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined according to the Acuity and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in bivalent studies than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and BivaliDrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hematoma of ≥ 4 g / dl without apparent bleeding centre, reduction of the haemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood allocation, which occured at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points of point, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study involving bivalent studies in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years have more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped into table 6 according to system organelles.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of an overdose, the treatment with Bivalira should immediately break off and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox includes Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the anion-binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or at tinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on its part reactivates the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Furthermore, bivalent-induced Thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) could not induce a thrombocyte aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivalent-udin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is proven by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was used in the following cases, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg should be given bivalent and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the Acuity study, fractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor either before beginning of angiography (at the time of randomization) or in PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the Acuity study, the characteristics of high-risk agents, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the three arms arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent 72 hours of angiography.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients have provided limited information about the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as Peptide is going through a catabolism into its amino acid resistance with subsequent reuse of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism, resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or as permanent infusion administered with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or unable to process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active life than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body no insulin can produce, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin is unable to work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adult type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in the comparison to a decrease of 0.14% for insulin injections.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0,30% with human insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta-can or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of decreased glucose-ogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effect, the brand (manufacturers), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method may undergo a change of insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-related diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change the treatment pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase propensity to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopyramide, fibromyase, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphs, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, the effect of sympatholysis such as beta-blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine may be weakened or missing the symptoms of the adrenergic antagonregulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin-lulisin surpasses into human breast milk, but in general insulin enters neither the mother's milk nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or through intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a coagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous gait of insulin lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male subjects aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus insulin lulisin showed a dose proportional to the dose ranging from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect of action as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosiness effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postprandial glycemic control is achieved, as with human insulin analog that is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandiale control was achieved than with a human insulin analog which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control as with human insulin analog insulin, which is given 2 minutes before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
