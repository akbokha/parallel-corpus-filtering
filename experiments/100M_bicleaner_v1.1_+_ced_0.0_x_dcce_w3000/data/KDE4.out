package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to use .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the map file tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras cr@@ ashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if present , delete .
the module overview filter ( also called folder filter ) can be accessed in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Options Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DOM tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DOM tree ... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the document &apos;s root node , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects using the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing w@@ ax@@ ed folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder than the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized when viewed far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the mar@@ vel presentation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched to color mode , can either represent depth for easy recognition of the tim@@ ber@@ ing depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is sufficient space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to occur . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
at installation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ port@@ in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . it is drawn as frame to avoid the dis@@ appearance of the entries . note that less space is lost for frames if the rect@@ angle is square .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry is assigned to the subordin@@ ate entries remains the implementation . hereby , it is advantageous for the label and to avoid placing of space by frame , so that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum laid area for an entry on the View View on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ Cach@@ egr@@ ind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you visit the module gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image editing with base image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC colour management - workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; through the camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ kam , tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests ... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is entered here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to join the user mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; digi@@ kam , and hopefully soon ask you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site ; visit the homepage to receive news about shared releases and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to register in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you &amp; digi@@ kam , first start , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to store your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam , you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ ti@@ h set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ sucht recur@@ sively the library path in its enti@@ re@@ ty . you cannot excl@@ ude sub @-@ folders unless it is the i@@ ste in hidden folders .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have any photos as icons . you can change them by using a random photo from the album and clicking this on the folder icon .
once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can get in &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My albums and My key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums .
the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Panel support menu .
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h Working Time .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transfer to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a freely distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . it also supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ is@@ sions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . the Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support does not exist in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ kam , is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images operates everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the tree , above the horizontal line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be put into keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to publish the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter will only be used for the fields shown in the symbol view . thus , the fil@@ tering works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind symbol view is displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the settings settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly to an album . select album Im@@ porting images . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select album Im@@ porting screenshot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by drag@@ ging or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select Properties from the pop @-@ up menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed together under a common name . the collection used by you is used to sort your photos , when you choose to add or delete albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make it in the collections settings .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by Date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , new ester : these set the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or that of passage of the album . to do this , first attempt to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; it is meant to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; Add as an album preview ; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be sealed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual pictures in the area My key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the associated preview . what information this is , you can click on settings digi@@ kam ; set up . select here the albums page and customize the preview image to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you allow the mouse cur@@ sor to rest a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screenshot above in the Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all what it is &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and Tags allow you to organize your photos in the way it fits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can reach all the functions that came with &amp; digi@@ kam , possible via the context menu of preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select . in the digi@@ kam , image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to adapt it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing , other image editing programs may result in problems with the metadata that is contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select fil@@ ming . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the date view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search .
when a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been selected with this key@@ word will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also collapse parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ ste@@ quot ; collapse , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported when losing the database as soon as &amp; digi@@ kam ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select New Key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this becomes the sub@@ title of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and selecting del@@ e@@ tion . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu which gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the key@@ word from the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select Add Album from the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to re@@ use &amp; digi@@ kam , you must first add your photos with keywords . this can happen in two ways : once you select the photos you want to add with a key@@ word , you can click on the key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on preview pictures and select key@@ word from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it assigned keywords . in this way you can set a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear in the main window under the thumb@@ nail preview .
you can remove a key@@ word by right @-@ clicking the context menu of the photo and select removing from the keywords menu . the menu will show you only the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus , all associated images will be shown in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
include all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
Neb@@ end er Such@@ box is a small lamp that will find green when the search results finds . if you click here the fil@@ tering will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again . if the search has not found anything then the lamp will red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab@@ s in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always fil@@ tering what you have entered as a search crit@@ erion .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and search will be done . the results will be used in the View My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection by searching again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the form appears to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit as an extended search , the dialog box appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced Search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select the Search button in the context menu .
the Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . all rules are displayed in line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list using the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or at least ... you can also search type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CHT@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes every image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . it allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natur@@ es , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : open @-@ hand colour sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ came ; find the matching pictures . here too , a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can press out or zoom out and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses your images ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lamp stand in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Leucht@@ tisch added from the context menu . the selection is added to the lamp table and its window is opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window , you can easily open the lamp table with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ nail you can drag the images you want to compare , in the left or right corner of the window and place there . if you want to synchron@@ ize photos from the tool@@ bar and perform Zoo and / or Tra@@ p operations on one of the pictures , then they are also executed in the other picture . so you can compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use pairs to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the areas for the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it on the left . this makes it easier to navigate through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions are also working directly from the lighting table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can recognize at the crossed arrows . in order to rot@@ ate the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold both pictures in the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the Zoom kno@@ b under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are pre@@ viewed in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos record , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos again . we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam , use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , file , group , back , optimize , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management records , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , conf@@ lic@@ ated and exports content that mer@@ ges a monetary or cultural value ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition files that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ kam . the approach to store metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and you need to know before you maintain something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you &apos;ll have to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; ex@@ porting is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements like version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for that content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend saving the metadata in the settings page of metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item from the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam , give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now select every photo keywords , labels and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . it makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the next work .
now let &apos;s proceed with key@@ word , keywords as you frequently call or categories in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ word , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or put the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are from &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the graph shows how different metadata is over@@ cut . this is a very coar@@ se representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start seeing some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him through the motive that moves you to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as a label . you can even export it for a selection of images . K@@ DE also provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with light speed .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels with images with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ kam , can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to Gallery@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information should be stored in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be the title like : employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be filled as well .
if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change this , in the image embedded metadata . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pro@@ s this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . &amp; digi@@ kam , will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that went missing on the street or a fire . this kind of loss is the same which can also happen with traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section we deal with problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be dealt with cau@@ ti@@ ously and you can &apos;t wait any longer than a couple of years . of course you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ved quality which last longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the correct way . the best DVD Recor@@ ders are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a control check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which appears to perform wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format of the format against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
slowly burn with a good recorder to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . likewise , read the data again to check you . likewise , do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks .
soon : dis@@ cos will stick to the longest when operating in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The faul@@ ts are the most frequent fault cause , SM@@ ART may not detect these errors . some of SM@@ ART errors termin@@ ate the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are especially reading errors and shift meters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical equipment does not make a lot of electricity , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed tests . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current tops is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and avo@@ ids the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection then you should pay attention to the fact that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning impact and therefore protects the properly connected devices .
as a over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripher@@ al devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ ax cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for traveling .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable power . it can therefore be useful to invest in a dis@@ rup@@ tive power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to save your data and run the system ordered . if you buy an U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity problems with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all the cables before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
however , they are much expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB are cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB are cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are provided on photos . your free storage is available to you more , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
the web solutions are very secure from the point of view of the data backup . transmission errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturb@@ ances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you open a photo one day . it is quite disturb@@ ing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems ever to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ efer@@ ences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors on low levels and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms using the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the amount of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the most . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spot@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file wasn &apos;t saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB HDD is now available for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , do not worry about anyone else for data loss . so , backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything more dangerous than re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing disks .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , one flash strikes you luck when the drive was not connected at the moment .
disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , the patch prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighbour house , into your office or the like .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss in spite of security is panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only disman@@ tled and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this is done compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
secure important images right after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
this approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC data , retained X@@ MP files , original retention , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be observed :
as the future is un@@ predict@@ able due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate while the time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility of changing a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc + dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software to read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG can be used as an open source standard for GIF . however , it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can provide relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and has slow compression .
TIFF was widely used as picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is already available for you and we hope that the competitors can use Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself .
many photographers drag it in front of an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive it . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine layer editing , you can use external programs . if you get the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam , edit , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . just export them into web gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Ad@@ ding a Photo to an Album you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your album database .
to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sing your digital camera , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras .
the Met@@ adata tab shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notes , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download S@@ elected . the S@@ elected button has been downloaded until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new download option is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you are using the buttons All for download or download S@@ elected , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folders are sorted . then select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all by clicking the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only a few , then you have to select it first and use Del@@ ete Del@@ ete Del@@ ete out .
please note that there are no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check whether the photos were successfully deleted in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ Album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera body completely , you should do so about the camera system , as this is much faster .
the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can result in double file names if you upload photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for database @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer , three more options open before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will affect the data from the author in the Standard Auto identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . for further adap@@ tations you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when you download it . or Up@@ per@@ cases , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of shooting to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section trim Met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , lets &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Advanced tab and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam , can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in that case stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced tab and select the date based sub @-@ albums at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; will appear where you can select the files which are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be up@@ loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means that a position is indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser to show the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam , users want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam site , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to store the position data of a photo .
the question is , how come the GPS data into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ i@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , artic@@ ulated and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and finally about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integr@@ ates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmitt@@ ing data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you need to save this data in g@@ px format , since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and width grade or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the trademarks of ha@@ iry coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam , tries to give you as much control of his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings dialog ; set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for writers : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as these are the image of other &amp; quot ; provider quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . these metadata is also available for other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam , without getting lost .
save images as embedded lab@@ eled cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the pictures . note : in images that already contain descriptions , they are over@@ written by the cap@@ tions .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cur@@ sor rests in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam will be tried , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that will not have any of these extensions , from &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset back by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ h to the right of each category .
the settings of the lamp by &amp; digi@@ kam , can be set on this page to the default values . each time you then open the lamp table , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better picture results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown pictures . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be selected with dar@@ ker or light colour in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the compression of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , because PNG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TIFF files option , you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality , since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm is los@@ s@@ less .
when setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy settings , the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata is not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard ann@@ ot@@ ation is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option , you solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the sh@@ ing@@ lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the pic@@ t@@ orial , so the parts of your images are burned in , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the highlights as well as transparent white . use the setting aper@@ ture white in the settings . the setting colors will trigger some unusual results , since it shows the highlights in various rais@@ ins . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of missing information from the highlights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you choose to recon@@ struct the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
put the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should go conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub@@ frame data that many cameras have and that are available in color @-@ fil@@ tered pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . it is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction correction , as you are carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to use them again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information how to translate color information from a color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ask if an image is opened in the image editing / Start Color Administr@@ ative Module with raw files .
color Profile folder Sets here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c in which you save all your profiles .
settings of the ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your images color does not paint the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color mapping or gam@@ ma correction . currently d@@ cra@@ w Gam@@ ma is not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon exten@@ tion can recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work together with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these will then be downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adju@@ sts the time between the picture transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes shut@@ down the metadata or from which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features show on the left a list of all camera supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on .
try out ob &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window menu . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the du@@ st@@ bin you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ kam ; setting a photo in an album by del@@ eting a photo . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album , you can find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly handled by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; during start @-@ up , this acceler@@ ates the starting process from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting Bei@@ m Start looking for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos to look for . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you see if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to review and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on thumb@@ nail viewing or selecting the item displaying / editing .
the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the image editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing features of the image processing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should therefore create a copy of your image before you change it . you can save this with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore menu or using the button The Rest@@ ore Machine button Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last Save .
almost any action in the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Recovery from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z , and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for re@@ covering .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the back@@ end or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a pop @-@ up menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the picture and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the startup menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically
full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can view this in the settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ kam ; modify it from the &amp; digi@@ kam , main window . see the section for setting up the image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sets . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select print Assistant from the menu album Ex@@ porting job wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a page bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge again .
in the inscription view , you can enter or paste let@@ tering with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters will be re @-@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ lic@@ ator button or simply switch to the next picture , the labelling will then be saved .
besides the user button , there is a button more . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata to the files . however , this is always done if you selected a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the review section shows an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the key@@ word preview shows a search box to filter the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; session applied key@@ word .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if you select multiple images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter .
the side@@ bar key@@ word filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , key@@ word and search views . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all displayed keywords are available .
if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears , which asks you if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper case the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is selected with no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog box asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or one , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced Search on all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the Groups button . the options look like this :
why not listed pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r ? free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adjusted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predict@@ able devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or sc@@ anners and the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the issue comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should I use another color space and thus have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click Info and then on information about RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cal@@ li@@ fy my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor , because s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ itor works on s@@ RGB , then you must either cal@@ li@@ ze your monitor to the s@@ RGB @-@ standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before trying a further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , Automatic balancing and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ating Automatic Cor@@ rection automatically try out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ ars the lumin@@ ary values over the entire picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
compar@@ isons : this method adju@@ sts the brightness factor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity canal is as shallow as possible . thus , the result is very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic lev@@ elling : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light borders and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete history of the hist@@ ogram .
contrast enhancement : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can lie too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which operates in 16 @-@ bit mode , your chances of correc@@ ting will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. Joch@@ em . they start it via the menu entry colors white balance of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original whi@@ tish screen again then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the target photos preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the top right is a hist@@ ogram that is dynam@@ ically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful there , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . shadow adjusting lets you improve or di@@ mming the sh@@ ading details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are also set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the pres@@ ets list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white balance . this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance that you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
the pres@@ ets button re@@ stores all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
here you can set the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit enco@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this enco@@ ding requires more disk space , data time and is available only for PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , allowing you to use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provides four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar ari@@ zation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when using a partially developed print a short flash light and subsequently inver@@ ted the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas were dar@@ ker and the colors inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually generates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it , it em@@ bel@@ li@@ shed many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a revers@@ ed color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to increase satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous thickness / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool ton@@ ing correction is used to improve exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the slider area for the application in question . more concrete the three scrap@@ ers below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ ene three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the kno@@ b and take care of how the image changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is mostly dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic distribution is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tone , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three color p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadow , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is visible in the foreg@@ round .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later on . to do this , the Gim@@ p Lev@@ els format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel modified by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images recorded with a digital camera , linear mode is the most sensu@@ al . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a broad beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a cur@@ sor to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright shades correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and become dar@@ ker the associated image pixels .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see . if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change , a fitting line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and Load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black white photo , which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer for image editing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . if you position it in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness , as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color will lead to a visible noise coming from the far@@ my@@ . far@@ bro@@ s consist of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that don &apos;t appear at the same spot in the color channel and their noise patterns are different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color needed first .
save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . preserving the L@@ umin@@ anz option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) to see .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is one work step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) jel@@ ly filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit col@@ dness in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of a pressure of a pressure and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . in detail , the image trans@@ forms with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce ren@@ ders it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative Inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text in a picture at any place . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any settings you have selected for your text can be changed until you click on the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template , you can put a template on a picture .
the menu Picture template using in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions on size and orientation . however , you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , submit an email in english to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ liste digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you have to place your template folder in dialogue with the button base folder . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after set the root folder for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the templates folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the templates bar .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this kno@@ b decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture bl@@ ur@@ ry . actually , it does not work a bit , it works more psych@@ osom@@ ally . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digi@@ ti@@ zation process colors with only minimal differences . elements that are smaller than the resolution will therefore be taken together to form a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more retro@@ fit shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
for JPEG images a camera has been used internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness tool .
you should be careful , however , as the results do not seem very natural : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases sharp@@ ness of edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus on more information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ gel and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of radius or amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur@@ ry mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats are created near sharp edges .
the radius represents as many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount is the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red picture added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thereby for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted from shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence fair@@ ness defects in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to draw a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur@@ ry mask . re@@ focus mostly achiev@@ es better results than bl@@ ur@@ red mask .
in practice the circular circuit works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche f@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche f@@ ission has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the sw@@ elling pixel which are far from the original pixel . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value should give 1 good results .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation is reduced the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.0@@ 3 . a high value will make the image even more poll@@ uting .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur@@ ry treat is sch . in most cases , you should let this value be zero to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and store buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focus parameter which you have set will then be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg . when JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could cause the un@@ sharp mas@@ king to use a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . in practice , the result of the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur@@ ry mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture :
this image has to be corrected with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator regul@@ ator sets the bl@@ ur of the area dark@@ ened , in order to generate a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink bag allows for a modified colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool l@@ acked correction is one of the most sophisticated tools to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the Pre@@ ferences tab and advanced settings .
detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ th@@ ness about the image . weigh@@ ting bigger values mainly homo@@ geneous regions fl@@ atten and details sharp . note that the detail preservation should always be subordin@@ ated to the directional dependen@@ cy .
direction @-@ dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes ev@@ enly throughout all directions , while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed just in one direction . if you have a movie gr@@ inning or CCD noise will produce a high value shaft @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best fixed at a value near 1 .
smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ th@@ ening factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ th@@ ness . set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise occurs , since it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it has to be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is enough .
angle adjustment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable to your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you receive by choosing this option is only low . however , it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let it out .
the buttons Save as and Load are exactly that . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the cancel button .
below you can see how to remove picture fl@@ aws with Small Art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that wor@@ del@@ .@@ Das Original@@ bild ist unter ( 1 ) zu sehen und das corrected Bild unter ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm from Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or ha@@ irs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time needed for the filter per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore adjusted smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubri@@ cation occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise tips may occur . put it to a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the picture . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ ening process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the picture . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ ening process that is controlled by the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically rough@@ ened more strongly .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear at edges . it can remove sp@@ ik@@ es and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the reduction of noise you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ acking for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for soft@@ ness using the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ gel and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ie . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of und@@ esi@@ red art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ularity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or after@@ ward digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tures . the texture composition is performed with a different tool , the image error correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ ich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm he creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ e@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any settings of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ ding on the faces .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts created by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially with high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; in a photo with a dark @-@ picture extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark@@ image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark image and load it automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ ject these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square finish ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ ject the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic finish ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ ject the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) to see .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corner , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not ev@@ enly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise non @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are caused by motion .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s film and color range of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a cent@@ er@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a cent@@ er@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can check the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light em@@ itting at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , giving an optical filter with aper@@ ture settings of 1 , or acci@@ dentally at a light intensity of 2 , incre@@ .@@ In@@ cre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
adjust the brightness , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction decreases the brightness of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a correction of the lens and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth degree cor@@ re@@ cts the distant corners opposite to that of the second count . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
in general , this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion of the second degree . with negative values t@@ ann@@ ular distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of distor@@ tion fourth grade . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value re@@ ates the image size and results in correc@@ ting the first count . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview illustr@@ ates the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as standard values at the next start .
the t@@ onn@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . best , perform this correction as the first . in case you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a t@@ ann@@ ular correction , the effect would be the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distor@@ tion , the resulting picture will have black verti@@ ces . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit menu from the image editing or via the Zoom kno@@ b of this dialog .
the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as pictures from the front , frame and painting is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of t@@ onn@@ en@@ ular correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infr@@ a @-@ red film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters set of film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add movie tra@@ jec@@ tory if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ b changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
since the filter mix@@ es color channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce some kind of au@@ ra in the highlights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter film gran@@ ularity is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce fil@@ ter@@ gra@@ ding on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film structure effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets loose from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity matches ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better for large images . smoothing controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side , the hin@@ d@@ iness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the edit is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ ths 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon copy . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was marked in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows setting the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving Filter@@ . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art using distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the kno@@ b button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art using non @-@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ ity : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a centre . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur@@ ry : wi@@ ping the image by turning the pixels at a centre point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance @-@ bl@@ ur : wi@@ pe the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
motion def@@ le@@ ction : wi@@ ping the image through horizontal moti@@ ons of the pixel . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
plasti@@ ci@@ zing bl@@ ur : wi@@ pe the picture soft@@ ly into the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low .
sho@@ vel @-@ proof : bl@@ urs the picture with random displac@@ ement of the pixel and thus simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a camera that is arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ry : find the bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pe it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool for making rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it into the right orientation using mirrors or turning .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change transforming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to t@@ weak the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam , uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was infl@@ ated by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the Tab@@ s New Size and are listed below :
ret@@ aining aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the original image aspect ratio is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise occurs , since it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it has to be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each entry for photo can be saved as a text file and then loaded later .
blowing photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by adding a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just have to use the mouse only the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle , create . you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
if you left the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply clicking the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the Edit button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool After cutting aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in the high @-@ format , always the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format width is assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horizontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as standard values depending on orientation . the changed image data are saved in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image .
the setup help settings allow help to hide , so that you can put together your images better . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ hed@@ geho@@ g , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower sheets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden spac@@ ing at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious .
the golden mean provides more liquid aid lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third el@@ bow , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition performs the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flu@@ x on this kind .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral mentioned above . its verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden angles are no uniform tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can leave a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry by professional photographers . try to place your pic@@ toral focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the colors reflect and reflect ver@@ tic@@ ale can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image .
free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo then it &apos;s easy that you don &apos;t hold the camera exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rot@@ ate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are shown in degrees . with the pres@@ ets button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after fil@@ ming an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally Cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after turning . note , however , the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
turn left at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
corner right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little bit dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with trans@@ formers cutting out of the image processing .
the she@@ ar tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , moves the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can sc@@ atter horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
to your help a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ illing tool to adjust your image .
after you have completed the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single layer this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two deposits generate twice as much bl@@ ushing and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has un@@ earth@@ ed tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with trans@@ formers cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependen@@ cy of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that knows . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is displayed in image editing . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam , supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures for digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read below Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF using the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the section Con@@ figuration you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . this includes more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam , but is no film editor and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit films . if you click on a movie file , you can use the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies to start playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the White balance module .
many tools you need the photo editing need in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ ten@@ ers , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; Text@@ ur applicable ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ating . the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left compartment shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ Mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can press out or zoom out and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses your images ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the entire system or just one user . in the latter case , they are stored in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette Editor , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it indicates the color beside it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor over there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box add C@@ urs@@ or under the button Color is enabled , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or ski@@ pped another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ ride was selected . this mode you can set by selecting over@@ writing under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or .
a selection that was created in such a way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character in case another color is followed . if three numbers are in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; graph @-@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; include , are out@@ dated according to the program author &apos;s &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph @-@ project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph is in &amp; are ; the graph new pays off and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; kate ; To open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in one &amp; two ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graph@@ s pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . needed in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon file and open the ( empty ) list to open the dialog .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings dialog .
if you open a graph@@ ed file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; instance open &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance or display the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
during the program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come to a page , are to be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph .
side preview with a graph@@ ene distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Save load page gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ers ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior in this case ( open the graph@@ s in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the session already running ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or un@@ lock the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which appears normally at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for orient@@ ated graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of orient@@ ated graph@@ s . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ finished graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates for un@@ finished graph@@ s a spr@@ ing@@ bike layout . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man pure gold he@@ uris@@ tics , and includes a multi @-@ wire cataly@@ st for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the k@@ not circular in accordance with the description of Six and tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .

read the K@@ IP@@ I module images to read new pictures and store them .
this module can be used to read and save new pictures from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source of which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by changing the default du@@ cr@@ he &apos;s own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after scanning the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the image file options . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots can be created after you selected the Import &gt; Screen Photo ... menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen photo modes :
select the complete desktop to read a single window below the mouse .
if all its own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear to enable you to view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the entire desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate back .
after the screenshot has been made , the dialog box displays options of the target picture with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF &apos;s keywords and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo to loc@@ alize . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS sign as XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with G@@ PX file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation is done which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracks are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below the data is brought together , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for images you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the kno@@ b cor@@ relation to inter@@ ject .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog box coordinates the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and zoom si@@ e.@@ Add this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool for export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below you will see the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option for each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the Reiter album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you want to write permission . a sub @-@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail image allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user as far as the action is . press Canc@@ el to Canc@@ el the Process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically end at the end to preview the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to look at a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ aus@@ ages . it was developed for quick image showing and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is increasing , since no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look ex@@ i@@ ii to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool for converting a series of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can insert a base image transfer . you can also add an audio file in the mp@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . then you can create the module using Extras MPEG Slideshow .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images respectively the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the picture process is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let it black . the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all your preferences , you can start the production of the movie with the button .
if a note appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to programs of M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages using the Settings button on the right .
the print wiz@@ ard allows to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW formats into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original itat from Him is : don &apos;t expect it to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ f ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion output . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , TIFF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images often or else you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata stored in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . use this mode therefore if you are safe , for example by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the albums .
this module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 di@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 di@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional scale changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
pre @-@ press : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo screen . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the most recently selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them down to add them to the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you selected are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
do not make sure to send too many pictures at a time . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after choosing comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are put together in a text file and sent the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted for los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in images file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original dig@@ its data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation uses very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option displays that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select make sure the pictures appear in a random order . so it is not used the order of pictures in the album .
the time distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . by chance , each transition between images sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slideshow you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can pause the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for placing an image as a background image for the desktop .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have updated your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumb@@ nails .
if you select people using the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the pictures are shown on which both individuals can be seen . by using this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a thumb@@ nail image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button that is located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to select the image for each individual . here you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor to your li@@ king and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you call the search in the main window , a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for creating the image properties . you can see this dialog on the picture once more .
if you enter a string sequence in the label or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , are not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals but try out some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen photos and the intro@@ duc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; first start , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . after that , some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; view the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each box then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in preview ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data , drag . if you select an area , you will only preview pictures of that period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images . one is in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create using the File HTML menu ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the look and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the overview page . see more information on export files in .
finally , you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that all pictures are from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are clear , which is why it is not specifically received .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download images that have for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , place the various folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . to enable the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub @-@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings just described have moved all three to basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time spent doing this , you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all the images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and share this file so independently . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a two @-@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL that you have given when creating HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access through the File Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
with the Manu@@ ell option close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to Automati@@ cally copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option on this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard for import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the im@@ porting images are to be copied .
it may be that you are the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named for your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the file to import are imported and which categories they comply with in your database .
in the fourth step you can synchron@@ ize the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the image .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will see the various steps of ( 1 ) laying down the information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo Album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup using a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the C@@ VS .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and uses them for future starts automatically . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will see the different settings options .
to the left , you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the option you want .
you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each picture . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , for example , set all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in .
you can see the settings available to you to specify the member groups . with the selected drop @-@ down list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ lib and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the modules itself .
since the modules are used together by several applications , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own images .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album ;
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all pictures that show you the preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also pass a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category you specified in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you would have selected people to view and pass this to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start Settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the top of a menu and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the pictures to show you an overview of all the existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image was taken , etc . you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can use them again and again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are depicted , you can , by moving the names used up , find the people more quickly and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol by date under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the images before and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have added several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al items at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special icon will be displayed .
in the Comment dialog &apos;s context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub @-@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to sort it in an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you can sort your categories in alphabe@@ tical order .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars , which form the edges of the frame , click and move . you can also create your own window by drag@@ ging it out of the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button , which allows you to store the current setup and appearance of the window among other things .
you can also completely hide a box . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and here window an / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with preview pictures of the currently selected images , or any images if you have no filter set . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit menu . now the window will display you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; can provide you with a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the pictures somewhere , thus &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also preview these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy and re@@ paste files from the folders . if so , if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , such as the jum@@ pers of your images , please buy a larger hard disk to save all the pictures on it .
in the picture menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the images that you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click Upd@@ ated View shut down in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also use all the images that your little sister can see , control and use the menu entry All except for up @-@ to @-@ date view .
this allows you to determine which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your little sister the laptop , simply select the menu entry images , so that all the pictures you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select the password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture @-@ protection is by no means very secure . on one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves those who are not very familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to look at private pictures .
the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . of course it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered about the image , such as who is on the image , when and where it was done , etc .
if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag it with the mouse and drop it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the appropriate entries for this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can be controlled by pressing C@@ trl key and plus respectively Min@@ us . started and stopped the slide show by pressing C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag in the image and zoom out . to enter the zoom , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button , you can zoom out the zoom button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the key button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the equality key , zoom the zoom , so that each pixel corresponding to the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they are in and out with the plus and mini key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you look at images it may happen that you &apos;ll find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you will probably prefer to mark only the picture and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to add images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pushing the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just put all of them at once with notes . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you show categories in Show view , then you can add character to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you can paint &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; painting on the picture .
the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted later .
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties and the object in the wire model views is yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all the objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu item in the inser@@ tion menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
you can remove selected objects from the scene by del@@ e@@ tion from the Edit menu or from the right mouse button contex@@ tual menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description .
when you enter the Path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with the help .
you need the Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
if you want to render only part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross local .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or below one view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map of the map to the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the top left in the fas@@ cia bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position .
the current window view can be saved with View Window order ... store it . a dialog appears where you can store the window orders under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar icon or select View Sc@@ ene View menu .
a render mode matches the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar , or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each rendering mode has a name . you can type any name , it makes sense , but it is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the map card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the cross section sub@@ section and enter the image editing window into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the characteristics , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions . a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the User Manual to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ira pattern or incre@@ mental effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and bin@@ ds &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . the default is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is constantly re @-@ split and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ tory depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain number of pixels with super sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually followed and checked for further division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that creating noise for the ray process , called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch off j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays at a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for the display of Pov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this .
to import a PO@@ V@@ RAY file , select File Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command line of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when im@@ porting error messages , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene , simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can paste the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place the path to your documentation and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 will be supported .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identi@@ fiers .
you can set the object start of the points on the Grid in the contex@@ tual menu of the wire model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projec@@ tions , all the wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions from perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature creates a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a ground beneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge of the edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more accurate information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section explains how to create and save window orders .
the combination field Standard window Order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window orders show all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window setting . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card board you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ lessly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window orders :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry called camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the camera &apos;s basic settings , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the camera &apos;s point of view . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the user button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change instantly according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . you might , for example , insert a header ( insert fin@@ ite body qu@@ ad ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or En@@ ter . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the level as well , even at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you will notice that you can open the item for the bottom if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise one unit below the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something in the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted . please select First Floor . the pig@@ ment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ment preview only shows a matte black material , because you still need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see color on the header and ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you want to render your picture now with one click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the colour list , you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the property tree you need to insert two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select each time mon@@ ochro@@ me and change the colors in the object &apos;s view :
you should already be able to perform this step , as you should have understood the basic mode of operation of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the user to press ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the floor by one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color :
select First Under@@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then choose Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog impact . thus , the scene is processed pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and space .
restore the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
you can only select this menu item if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last return command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used editing .
stores the current window orders and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option pre @-@ set short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre @-@ use rough surfaces without having to be able to model any b@@ ump on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give color to the surface of an object color on pixel base by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or full@@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Dias@@ how , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ball show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when ending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show opens ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ett@@ show ; to set up only some of the file types that the program can also display .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
speci@@ fies whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time interval between the picture change with a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field .
here change the short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ball show ; in the card cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
the image decreases by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ Photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its part to having at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry containing problems or requests . this displays a dialog with a link . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to report your message .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto ; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to introduce you to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , you can ask questions to other users of other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to take part in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
show@@ Photo ; tries to give you as much control as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you will need to select the show@@ photo settings in the menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left .
in the exposure indicator , you can select the color displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ wise , the colors should be contra@@ sted with what you are supposed to indicate in contrast . exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ Photo ; has a page bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . the same page bar is also available in the image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that does not make more than images to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that does not make more than images to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner support on SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not open or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to select the image better the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the complete preview into the window .
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you preview a preview in the settings before saving then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and sh@@ aded ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before saving should be selected preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; Add images . open dialogue to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each image you sc@@ anned . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored at the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that is highly counted every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE Over -@@ Dialog box for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the kno@@ b settings dialog displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs button short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and function . you can set up the global short@@ cut by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting Global button short@@ cut . you can set up the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; specific short@@ cut can be set by right @-@ clicking in the player window and select short commands ... Select .
you can set up your existing multimedia buttons to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many common functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , etc .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data using Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should include any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow to run external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the setup data , each script itself needs to take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
tr@@ ack@@ Change signals that a new piece is pil@@ ed up . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to retrieve more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title Path Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files in the play@@ list , if a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . in order to add an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clean@@ up work . this includes saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b download from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend a archive name such as my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok @-@ script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the introduction of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly design@@ ate your script pack@@ ets .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wiki Script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; App@@ ly . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the play@@ list instead of having to work through endless menus . you might also search only a very specific title from thousands of your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collections browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you may have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to listen to ? then the play@@ list browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many gen@@ eric USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many more useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
when the player window displays the player window in addition to the play@@ list ( or . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window will be displayed ) .
use vo@@ icing bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer is changed .
set voice files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is checked , mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings @-@ folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise , .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings @-@ Fol@@ der of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save play@@ list when moving , saves the current play@@ list automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is saved .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece during piece changes causes the play@@ list window to roll down / roll to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when changing the context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is pil@@ ed up .
in the appearance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the Fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise grey described section through marking of own fon@@ ts . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ list window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom colour scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector included for foreg@@ round and background color .
continue playing at the start cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the play automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font type for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for ty@@ pe@@ face and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if O@@ wn colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the Display Text entry field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to determine which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card card .
the map card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to browse for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the displayed as well as their sub @-@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the play@@ lists automatically added will then appear in the play@@ list browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down box driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , further installation is necessary in the My@@ S@@ ql installation window .
the My@@ S@@ ql file is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : the calcul@@ ator is entered where the database is located : the network port is entered , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Pass@@ word : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ fm addresses the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece as needed .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm website .
send played pieces to refres@@ h the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm profile .
calling similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to retrieve the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ fm profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ enshots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to get rid of k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will make trouble for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the tag@@ lib library for days . you can locate the file by following in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer on bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and then app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if Z. B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X compiled , this leads to crash when processing the met@@ a information .

you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email will automatically open during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark this as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .

to fix this bug , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are ligh@@ test by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with developers .
LiveZilla is a great software , it has a lot of features , that , without any doubt , help our organization to have a close and ...
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty play@@ list appears . how do music pieces enter there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window was converted into the statistic window . you can find it under Extras Firmware .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to review pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the play@@ list . click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title bar of the play@@ list and select column display . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then hit Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and select From play@@ list remove from the drop down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them drop there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s the simple thing : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , next to the Add button , you can save the play@@ list button . click on it .

none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be supported by Which media types supports G@@ Stream@@ er / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 de@@ co@@ ders are provided ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option &apos; Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously to output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. sb@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in the search for the problem cause and solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to indicate another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
do not forget that media need to be de@@ co@@ ded first . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stream@@ er is the best choice for most people if you want a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . ensure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set :

either use G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine instead , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dreams react to the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er , you need to register all the components . register g@@ st @-@ register to register all the G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stream@@ er .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run g@@ st @-@ register , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ config ) and run g@@ st @-@ register again .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : s@@ sh -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ window . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size variable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the queu@@ e sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing the input button after a search in the play@@ list , the first search result is played and the search is reset .

basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can apply the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ list window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and editing : selecting or pressing F2 . you can also edit the review in the Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not connected with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .

now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install again .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok set up ... audio output specify the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
&quot; &quot; &quot; { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter in the configuration dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio edition with Arts will not be taken care of . you may want to take this problem by yourself ! if you like , you can become the new so urg@@ ently needed child@@ min@@ er for Arts : )

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a play@@ list that is superior to any other . the play@@ list window contains several browsers that can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok can be used , including creating a collection and a play@@ list .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current running track or current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zers by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
under the run@@ time display there are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the kno@@ b PL is activated or dis@@ ables the play@@ list window , while the button E@@ Q is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window is composed of the play buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the play buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in e@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the e@@ quali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check@@ box , the e@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed play@@ list of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that there are in no other player . but don &apos;t let the full@@ ness of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be split into two main areas , on the left hand side of the navigation pane . in the navigation section you will find some of the excellent play@@ list functions , such as the context browser . on the right hand side , the play@@ list itself . the play@@ list is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub@@ windows will later still be explored in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might notice that the window has been dropped off . the information shown here is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistical window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music displays information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the images can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the pop @-@ up menu .
the last section , albums of the interpre@@ ter , lists all the albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the play@@ list from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . there is no running text script required .
the Find button opens a search to goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group@@ ed the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - At first , the pieces are arranged according to the performer . if you want to see combinations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - S@@ ort by interpretation and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpre@@ ter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces are sorted by genre and among them by performer .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This attitude works just like the above , but is additionally sorted on album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you own something at the selected folders . if you own lots of pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes about using this filter can be found in the section to the play@@ list in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , from the last 24 hours to a year . in addition , you can also select your complete collection , so the filter is practically disabled .
by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This displays the current play@@ list and inser@@ ts the selected pieces in the current order in the current order .
attach to play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will play you next .
save as a play@@ list ... - Save the selected pieces as a play@@ list . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queu@@ e for transmission to the media player . see the Media Player Browser section for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpre@@ ter / burn on CD - Due to the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for pieces information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files to the du@@ st@@ bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , after which it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
syn@@ op@@ sis - Chang@@ es a compilation of marked album back to a normal album . the album will then no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again among the associated interpre@@ ters .
the play@@ list browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists , including Smart Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically generate some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created Smart Play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Intelligent Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the Media Player sub@@ window will be used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod you need to be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the required tracks from the play@@ list and let them drop on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive band@@ aging for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL . if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can access music from there in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop music from there to the play@@ list .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply drop down . in that case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : thereby dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the play@@ list contains all the pieces attached to the play@@ list . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter characters , only the pieces are displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter by whit@@ esp@@ ace separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter one or two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
when you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you would like to search for entries that contain spaces , then wrap the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you may also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax versions as you wish . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bad .
you can set the selection sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then click on the entries with the right mouse button . the entries will then have a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned .
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is at the bottom of the play@@ list . it contains buttons for some functions of the play@@ list . on the left side , you can find the Add button to add the play@@ list to the play@@ list .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the play@@ list .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bars , for example play@@ lists and volume control . you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars there ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the play@@ list . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . in addition , the status of random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed easily by clicking the mouse twice in the respective display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the play@@ list .
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can choose the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
this entry hi@@ des a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch it by choosing actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from :
the queu@@ e management received your great suit in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the play@@ list . after you set a piece into the queu@@ e , the play@@ list will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the plays will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
the queu@@ e management will open you through the queu@@ e administration . if you want to add a piece of the queu@@ e , select the piece in the play@@ list and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the play@@ list or use the context menu in the play@@ list .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up this follow later ) .
fill your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces during playback .
adds items based on Last@@ .@@ fm recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need any Last@@ .@@ fm profile so that this dynamic play@@ list works .
double click the play@@ list you want , drag them to the play@@ list window or right click on it and then select Load . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old play@@ list under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of mix and play@@ list mix immediately fill out your play@@ list and you can start playing directly . the play@@ list recommended pieces will start with an empty play@@ list and you must add at least one piece of your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing play@@ list as starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu item .
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current play@@ list and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the corresponding settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog will open to edit the play@@ list settings .
enter any name for the play@@ list here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will grow continuously , the setting for coming plays will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a piece twice in this play@@ list . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the songs played .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the play@@ list , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the play@@ list after each played play . if you set more than 1 , the play@@ list will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you check .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer want to use a script anymore , you can delete it . select the script to be deleted and Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Wr@@ ite of Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin simply enable the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps you need a exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will receive a bad quality when enco@@ ding MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog window you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps you need to have a exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , Cop@@ y CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original is completed into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media on which the data should be fired .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; runs the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; runs the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC may not find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org where you can get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and get news from the forums .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program bur@@ ns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; and extends these functions even . so choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs out . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio enco@@ ding technology . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . currently , it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three Audio layers layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a far @-@ developed MP3 Dec@@ oder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X audio enco@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the various albums can result in the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will be played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically return all videos to the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the file previously created will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . that is the same as if you would call for each individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and has not been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between stores and modifications . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project that is not stored , just as if you would have called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project not stored , you &apos;ll be asked what to do with it , as if you had called File Cl@@ ose .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog . that has the same effect as if you are moving the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the &quot; Fir@@ ing &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is that ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you view files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than aid , so you can see the files and folders already existing on the media .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
this allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the Cop@@ y dialogue , so the target medium needs to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about read video , enco@@ ding settings , and even ways to change size and cut black borders .
displays information about the pic@@ kled medium . this information is displayed in the content view and features properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . when an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view features an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ lock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view allows the selection and drag of files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can change the mapping association settings below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general programs can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with one &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example .
to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task are key to which the mut@@ ing programs give you the default .
in this chapter we assume that you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to make use of the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following in the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; program , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
int cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created Project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project about the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ rough using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String node ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ne@@ wn@@ ame ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this allows you to fill in a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; output for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in wa@@ v files on disk ) and by many enco@@ ders enco@@ ding these WAV files ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ der packages can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored into WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per titles ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ der needs to be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which enco@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to destroy any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device remo@@ ves the protection , it is not possible to deal with the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid buying copies of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up as often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily use to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , there are more information about how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configuration of the program .
if the CD@@ DB request the CD @-@ data on request in the CD@@ DB register ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if enco@@ ding is configured in the code settings dialog , enco@@ ding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of enco@@ ders available so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der in the code settings dialog was configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected for coding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , ports ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; ex@@ pi@@ red ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as En@@ coder , for setting the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files .
under the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality in deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG player devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate of about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate of about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ anlagen . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ stated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be transferred / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help with the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and title needs to be added to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer . it must be noted that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note from the translator ) I &apos;m not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information publicly available on the &amp; CD ; and in addition , the information without the &amp; CD is more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select an address ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This may only be the program@@ mer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and bal@@ ances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org gives an up @-@ to @-@ date list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more about it , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first once this has not happened .
to save the extracted wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be found on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ der can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the enco@@ der installed .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading genuine on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD . to do so , check the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to it ( eg ; by trying to copy a bit into it ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each recording &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compres@@ sing the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time of reading a &amp; CD ; change once the right settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .

the card card General settings . here you do not have much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot .
only In case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be notified when details of generating key@@ word ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starting immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually input everything , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use it twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two selection panels must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is a fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screenshot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will function as a first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as there are many fire@@ walls running the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activ@@ ating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings of the screenshot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
the number at the same time : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one available drive ? parallel reading and enco@@ ding ? the author does not know it , so simply try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to disc@@ ard the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be blocked to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to de@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
this is , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; termin@@ ated . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs to the hard drive . we will set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the preceding section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; cd .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen shots look somewhat different from the data you have received from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually insert data instead of fet@@ ching them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened , then the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search in the section Ques@@ tions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check@@ box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer has to enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words are beginning with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the enco@@ ding settings tab ; take a look at the &apos; Basic settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD ; this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information , go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example can be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you return to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the pieces of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the fre@@ ed@@ b data . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the pieces list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or click the All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when you click on the selection button selecting the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message appears if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and enco@@ ding . in case of low @-@ performance machines the result is un@@ clear . the used computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and enco@@ ding ( of , however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; will run C@@ VS as part of the multimedia package today . if you are familiar with C@@ VS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you are reading this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screenshot of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any locking point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you want to add or change something useful , let it do . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agre@@ es with this proposal .
stran@@ gely , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and car@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke and real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound Pro@@ jec@@ tor , which is needed for G@@ US maps .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( property events or text events ) . k@@ mid is automatically retri@@ eved by the method used .
when you start playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesi@@ zers , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Dis@@ playing button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the slider .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , so inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space button while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid to play .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics or other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically retri@@ eved which a song is used so you don &apos;t have to manually set anything manually . so if you want to select automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text is automatically selected . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the font properties and / or property events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these will be played after the series . in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the collection under the Organ@@ izer menu . click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . at the beginning this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can choose the desired collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection is not stored . remember that if you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection by opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then add the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to continue a song , select the next song button , next song from the menu item , or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the Previous piece , the previous Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map of General @-@ MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US maps , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file containing all the required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary for each occurrence to have a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END @-@ key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... END @-@ key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map &quot; ... END @-@ CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TION@@ S ... END
you see that define is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future releases of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it pic@@ ks patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term Tro@@ mmel @-@ Patch of the patch , where every note represents a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ acas , etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument .
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as is the presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names on the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussion channel . see for example the key@@ maps provided .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , just make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is shown on the N channel . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name for that channel is needed . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on that channel .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is determined in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as are available ) .
this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch @-@ b@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oct@@ ave higher . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you must try a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid to try .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find it in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the kno@@ b doesn &apos;t light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the Point Channel view : settings
the tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t comp@@ el anybody , &amp; k@@ mid to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid to have . that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agre@@ es to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first enable automatic add @-@ on to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I &apos;ve got on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you only want to listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage myself to program more on &amp; k@@ mid to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take some time for me . as a hob@@ bies , I have program , collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences .
if you want to know where to download mi@@ di / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anybody . I would therefore like to emphasize that I &apos;m only further program@@ mi@@ ere because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .

in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and view images . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ WE @-@ card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid to compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not listen to music .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the play@@ list .
it is possible to save the preferred links below the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you want to print an entry , your group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed using direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with play@@ list from the menu and either select Edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when editing mode leaves or another group is selected without the same as the play@@ list .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and closing can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; In@@ vert &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L will be supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
to play the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus always a given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the device and the TV channels need to be configured . this can be used to manually edit the scanner from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is to be used in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected from which one is selected . the enco@@ ding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
because the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux expansion needs to be functional for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , various names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any hint how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does each time my CPU need to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; file .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is likely to have access to package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow a simple installation without further compile and are included on the tile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the tile ; site should be made .
if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; C@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical user interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailored approach to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; therefore , and to learn its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; C@@ ile ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right expression : lay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also a la@@ ie ( eng@@ l. lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book to be given , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ fÃ ¼ r her@@ zog .
just like other accounting languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general features like paper format , page number@@ ing and text green are specified as well as a body with text . the introduction contains at least the \ \ begin { document } command and must be closed again using the \ \ begin { document } command .
the quick @-@ rise assistant of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; . selecting the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . it can also be done some on the document related settings .
document categories : this is the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , Cover &#91; Report &#93; , Report &#91; report &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projec@@ tor &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
enco@@ ding : this is used to set the character enco@@ ding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for inclusion , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use when creating German texts .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section .
&amp; C@@ ile ; as well as other source text editors - the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; K@@ ile ; if you see green areas of a green text on the screen , it is most likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless .
with automatic ful@@ fillment of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically generated a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the associated line to the closing of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Settings K@@ ile ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are normally divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph that is the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective object .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files may be very helpful , as soon as a DVI ; file is created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the respective line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the return search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element was cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it is applied . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is spra@@ yed in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other work@@ .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set for project project settings .
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there is no error in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file can be changed to Ã ³ n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â ¬ remot@@ ech@@ â ¬ remot@@ ely and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when looking at the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be found . the selection fields have been developed for fast inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for fast structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is available for items such as keywords , joint notes or references . the available options are :
description : with this command , a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( choice of a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ ll@@ Reference e is used for defining the font size . it enables the font sizes to be set for the main text , the joint banknotes , etc . , the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; C@@ ile ; two options are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brackets according to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or Kn@@ op@@ fs Schnell@@ bau .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; C@@ ile ; the storage will automatically exp@@ ire .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if this is not the case , it should also be taken into account when logging in . if this is not the case , it should also be noted .
environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with Font sizes e 12 is created , and only a few notes should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ shap@@ and \ \ end { environment } will then add the opening of the font depth ( l ) .
the changes are super@@ imposed only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , gre@@ ase pressure , intensive pressure , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the intensive printing and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lat@@ ex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sign language is shown , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile is followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the wiz@@ ard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments should be performed for better read@@ ability of the document . to this end , a quote , a few places in the gre@@ ase and intensive pressure and a poem will come to use to see the differences of these commands .
once the document was viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ trl @-@ E can be returned to the editor ( the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent fil@@ e@@ format ( engl . d e V ice I n@@ ologies ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document through file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into di@@ pped other formats can begin using the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar .
the previous search allows the direct jump from the editor to the left position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; C@@ ile ; offers a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only the Modern can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools upgra@@ ding will be selected .
the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source code and can be cli@@ cked on to select preference . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; doc by &amp; K@@ ile ; specified and sent to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; C@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( configur@@ ing the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using the rapid build of the &amp; DVI ; do not open , an error can be found . if an error occurred , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file has the error source in the source code . in the editor you can then use the previous L@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ester La@@ Te@@ X errors for j@@ umps between the errors . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; j@@ umps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to choose the template to be used for the document .
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard will be used for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section .
frequent user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be open or create a new file . &amp; C@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... settings can be adjusted .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document class . typically , it is used as such : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have to be executed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched by one on the Internet and can be executed under the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; therefore unique ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and highlighted by many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings can be made directly from &amp; K@@ ile ;
to learn more about &amp; are , and to learn its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; C@@ ile ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
&amp; C@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the menu Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way click \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor pane .
&amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many wiz@@ ards can capture additional jump marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu items edit jump marks or the corresponding button are highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Cl@@ ose ; . although &amp; are unique ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text added ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; include always many environments and groups , and therefore supports &amp; k@@ ile ; special commands for selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with plain lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command can also be selected at the end ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; C@@ ile ; offers with its own commands for faster access . editing Rem@@ ove are the following commands to delete the text :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit excer@@ pts paragraph .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands under editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the outline of the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted environment commands , quick overview can be lost . this command complet@@ es the last open environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; C@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those in the Edit environment .
with this command , jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the shar@@ pen@@ ing clip .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the shar@@ pen@@ ing cl@@ asp .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the shar@@ pen@@ ed cl@@ asp of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of scre@@ wed @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ed groups @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps quickly the opening overview can be lost . this command complet@@ es the last arranged group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy reference marks are used as an entry string . for the purpose convey@@ ing realization , the character is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two easy reference marks . also for the end of the support the sign &quot; is used . &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and creates two closing signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic system of double quotes can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , so that German or French suits are used . there are also many other languages available .
when pushing Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; C@@ ile ; a smart line break . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; K@@ ile ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , the line closes &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an attached line break .
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be configured under Settings K@@ ile ; La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some users want to assign the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all Et @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; K@@ ile ; try to reach this . if this tab@@ ulator is not possible the left tab@@ ulator in the current column .
although &amp; kate ; already a good source of source content offers , it was added in &amp; K@@ ile ; for special prec@@ ep@@ ts ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three according to need and the other two are configured for automatic adjustment . all these modes can be set for different ways of working under Settings K@@ ile ... fully adjustable .
at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ begin { surrounding } and k@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last character of the input will be removed and possible to set up the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , from &amp; K@@ ile ; also jump stamps can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of Edit Det@@ ection marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings K@@ ile ; Set up ... C@@ ile ; En@@ able can be done to these lists . you can select different pad@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ bÃ ¼ cher des Allgemeinen Sprach@@ krei@@ hs aus@@ wÃ ¤ h@@ lt .
the command mode is not useful for the en@@ unci@@ ation of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the inv@@ oc@@ ation mode will have a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for ful@@ fillment of environments is provided .
when calling the complete mode , the menu editor or the key key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically included and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key will be termin@@ ated .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile knows that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be included .
under Settings K@@ ile ; Set up ... tile ; En@@ able can be done to these lists . this mode uses the full list of Total Pre@@ par@@ ation mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; C@@ ile ; support custom lists of copies , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... Cl@@ ose can be fully set up . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which , for example , is included in the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the menu Edit or the word processor C@@ trl + Alt Sp@@ ac@@ ebar is replaced , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large e W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ bÃ ¼ cher is not helpful for automatic finishing . however , it has been found that many guards are written in one document more than once . thus , it offers &amp; K@@ ile ; the actu@@ alization for all already written gro@@ wers .
this mode can be set in the men@@ Ã ¼ Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile fully scre@@ wed down . here you can also specify the sw@@ elling value for displaying the ful@@ fillment .

the graphical dialog box creates the integration of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be followed .
PS files are not as familiar as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools re@@ arranged and then converted using ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all tools are group@@ ed together in the compilation of compile , creating converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for spec@@ t@@ ator like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard key Alt ; 2 . then the DVI ; file can be used in the default Viewer by means of old ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , each time a new window will be opened .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the script function of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ ile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed on scripts in vertical bars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
first , it must be said that the exec@@ uting environment of the scripts is in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly cl@@ ums@@ y system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents . there is a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a fully supported user manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents containing &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application of tex@@ tures containing a database with all documents delivered and herein for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or whi@@ st@@ les . by &amp; K@@ ile ; only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the owner of the space button opens the viewer for the document .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we lift it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on and done the symbol for the XML processor !
this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the ge@@ du@@ ous work folder , then release the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder field .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the recently opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current folder . if not , select up @-@ to @-@ date working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked already is checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if not , delete the file at current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection .
if you want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the well @-@ formed checks selection .
to use an &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , they select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG validation is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ xml@@ 2 library .

specify the name of the file as the result is named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; download , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . by doing so , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait for anyone to use the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin editing the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage and add all contained plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project involves several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose himself from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and pressing the button as suppres@@ sed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold to which you are : text .
nick@@ names and hi@@ ring of one &apos;s identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into the C@@ VS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the addres@@ sees selected in the recipient list . addressing can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to add comments is simple . it can be selected either the note item from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment area followed by comments text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader After the Area and Sub@@ project leaders , the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roll names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is supported and web@@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible from the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over a few pages that are dealt succ@@ essi@@ vely .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it . entries are :
big / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically close : if checked , will be inserted for tags , for which the closing day is optional , that immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
automatically update the start and end tag : when switched on , the appropriate tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for recognition of different types of files . the default values can be restored using the Standard button .
default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise than file opening files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . this setting here , however , is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates periodi@@ c backup copies , so that a power failure or crash during the next startup of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the window settings to the default back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come together by modi@@ fying M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages section is used to control the display of war@@ nings through hooks of no longer ques@@ tioning .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source @-@ text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action dissolved by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ cture tree configuration , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep during a change in the structure tree . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
the section to specify ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded in editing to more extensive text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means that there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are non @-@ part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a standard location as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refused to load . only Read @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the given information is correct . select the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the bug search was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . appears usually in the left dock .
a view where all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view that displays the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , anything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is fired by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally it is not necessary to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Start the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
tells de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution is continued . happens before a Debut requirement is started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without transmitt@@ ing information to monitored variables and the current time number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . happens before a request is made , the execution begins when a request is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible if possible in functions and include file .
re@@ jects the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current ones .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the vari@@ abl@@ a view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g that you can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ sl@@ db@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; can adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; can help you get better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for up@@ - and script languages as well as CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folders and tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbol @-@ oriented hard@@ est of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions more quickly insert into a document as a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog , den &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable fast inser@@ tion of tags to a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all is necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this item can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
gives the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a pattern name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can happen only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can happen only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may appear within the tags defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with one &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; what@@ s@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check over Tag@@ X@@ M@@ l . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only done when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
below is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
below is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file an &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ code = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for using DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; general &#93; Version = sol@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings action ... created . click New action to the same dialog :
this action assigned short@@ cut . by clicking the User@@ defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Quick start -@@ Dialog or the various see in ... actions for ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way , try to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / is removed from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be added to the PID @-@ number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script enters &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to accept the default input . in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , which are to be done with the text written on the default output .
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in a given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . choose Settings action .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , activate &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available to allow an input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , sti@@ ff , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; day in the current document is added .
after creating the symbol it must still be associated with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functionality to tool@@ bar , or you should set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set di@@ alog@@ s on Settings tool@@ bars . make sure the tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( all on the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by trying all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back up in the right folder . after Ne@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the right folder . please adjust their file tool@@ bar ( s ) to be loaded when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for documentation HTML files e.g. php@@ 42 / # Elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html Tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html Tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resources files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context @-@ aid , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML @-@ documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the fail@@ ing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . in different places there is a With Email Print menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , ship tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archives , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make an effective contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private g@@ pg key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can stay empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will start .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears to indicate the author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages that are not currently supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day XML format . there is the easiest way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which is to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tion line : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adjusted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use , available . from tool@@ bars to actions , everything that is marked global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in a global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ unds the joint use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the board companions with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the mouse on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card drivers , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click on the editor pane introduces a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as the basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags on the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; insert into your document , then click on the symbol representing the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box of different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with card managers are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done using the context menu displayed .
a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available script languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information from a script . by clicking the right mouse button , other functions are available , such as start the script , edit , or send an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document &apos;s position on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands is opening in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the application system oriented to the contents enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cards at the bottom end of the window , which can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this pack@@ et shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this File@@ Manager shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed tar@@ piece archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as any other .
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a close idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer in pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why Develop@@ ing what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ our is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to dramatically increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta execute ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later usage . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ prescri@@ bing so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ S@@ elling which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are given !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
activation and activation of the problem re@@ por@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ por@@ ter is activated as soon as one switches to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ bar on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a single click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects will be stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows , for example , to copy video files to your project folder or sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( KI@@ O slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... to be added . tool@@ bars will be saved via tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load one &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anybody else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
loading / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refresh@@ ed without rene@@ wing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu default in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activated or dis@@ ables the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar is denied if this day contradi@@ cts the rules at this location .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug@@ ins off it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ men@@ heb@@ ungs@@ sch@@ ema depends on the unique ; version .
select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using external application ti@@ dy .
due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes takes time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode corresponding to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
activ@@ ates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect every application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
speci@@ fies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; you find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which can add and modify the sequences .
this should generate help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed most from top to bottom , for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you handle local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .com ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static content that you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the folder are displayed and you can make a detailed selection of good th@@ inners .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by check hooks or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to top , also files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
this allows the selected de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed can be selected . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this , troubles@@ hooting is described .
in sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing its own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event &apos;s sub @-@ window , you can switch event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a certain event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . you cannot influence this behavior at present .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . open dialogue project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves equally , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button pop @-@ up menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the highly loaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button ends to prevent the removal .
the password will be stored in the kernel memory and forget it for programs . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is required and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . in editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to work on one &apos;s own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best with the menu tool@@ bar . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars will be treated at the bottom in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , it can remove other actions such as tool@@ bars , ren@@ ame tool@@ bars or set up tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog , which actions to be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action lab@@ eled , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bar ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in some the restrictions you imagine for the file system .
some templates supplied with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary templates are normally found in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be created from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
these templates are useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents , based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl @-@ base .
as the name says , these templates serve for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template save As local template save ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template for project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view template .
creating binary templates is simple : copying the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or paste via the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the project file tree view to a folder on the right and create site template , type a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can provide head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects .
template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is termin@@ ated as soon as the parent attribute has been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template chart . if a root folder is configured so , templates would appear in this path basically , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ block . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or updated text for templates in this folder . these could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er rows in a folder with custom he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second mode divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source code if necessary , in which the implemented changes are visible in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green icon depic@@ ts the V@@ oh@@ and@@ Win of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . with pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key print activ@@ ates the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable in settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can select between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small Span@@ ne for fast calcul@@ ators and a large Spanish for slow ones .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to mi@@ tig@@ ate the pend@@ ulum .
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click in the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and choosing the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing and deleted using back @-@ button or removing key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags does not remove existing identical tags , e.g. when a anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed from any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars , such as the table wiz@@ ard or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . in contrast to other styles of style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be tr@@ acked .
to use &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile , need but &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;
in a template , at one point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g , or at the current node . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , possible stops can be set in a specific file and time number and will be activated later .
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g calcul@@ ates the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . file names in the same folder as the top load file name with relative path to the folder with x@@ sl@@ db@@ g Is , for example , a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
this command checks to a partial or complete agreement with one feature named QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP ME that contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP ME &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extends to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after holding point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g .

&quot; &quot; &quot; when the command &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is executed , a x@@ ml file named search@@ result is created . this file can then be edited with a custom style template , in order to represent the data in other form , if the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prefer@@ html &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not set , the search@@ results file is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on systems with installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys to / from the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &apos; as argument is set a stop in a file named &apos; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &apos; .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
path : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML data or the XML _ document edited by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LEN@@ AM@@ E@@ gt ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to dis@@ solve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps with the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of complete folders . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and contra@@ sts with the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no longer if nobody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
folder ner@@ 2 folder ner@@ 1 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o Target folders k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 -@@ o Target folders
open @-@ Dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the open dialog shows your selection and displays them next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the file blank , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
through the folder Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons respectively merge of folders will be introduced . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when assem@@ bling is checked , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set a output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the compar@@ isons / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison will start immediately . in the open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would only need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t get out of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; only the drop @-@ down of text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three spring windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , the color indicates which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . )
the vertical line that divi@@ des the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . when the line break is activated , the line is displayed in re@@ fr@@ acted lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an Info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ v &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also indicate a jump in position in the windows where the first line of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left appears a black beams .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you may change your mind and perhaps select another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs .
navig@@ ates mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , side , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the aug@@ ust window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion key you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture Auf@@ wärts / C@@ trl @-@ Picture down ) or the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the marker into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . however , be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ ride the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ feed sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line ends of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of most recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and re@@ vert to the next startup . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font does not support this image , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered as@@ cert@@ ained . on these systems , the pres@@ ets button automatically creates an un@@ even color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pushing the tab@@ ulator button . otherwise a tab@@ ulator characters will be inserted .
if you press a return or return , the ind@@ entation of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each option is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying the manual into the clip@@ board then falls .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
at compar@@ isons of files , &amp; k@@ imper@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical rows in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step white signs are ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a number of wag@@ ons &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only store a line feed character , but then files with different sizes in the page @-@ on @-@ page comparison will look identical , but like a white character . if this option is checked , this option must be disabled . in default this option is disabled .
in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
this option is disabled in the default setting . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white signs .
the option is activated in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before moving forward to the next un@@ solved conflict .
trigger automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs in many files are less important . if you only use this from time to time , then use better the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also affects conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and mess@@ aging of mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation to directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , then the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ original . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further f@@ use .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop &amp; rest@@ art ; quit and rest@@ art , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is termin@@ ated globally via the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding a short notice is what local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the enco@@ ding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
disable this to supp@@ ress codes of changes in white signs in the text or super@@ visions . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences will be shown in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . depending on the selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be shown next to the normal yet another over@@ sigh@@ ted column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just end the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
assign the compar@@ ative windows next to each other or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art mer@@ ging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your needs .
when reading a file , it is passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used to input this pre@@ processor command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processor command for line comparison to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ ) \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The . * is a mer@@ cen@@ ary expression of the characters found on each string . the \ \ 1 in the translation string refers to the found text in the first clamp number . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command is required for line comparison : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre@@ processor command for line comparison suitable . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the composition from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l only needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging . further operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ up pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text is altered or hidden , you may not acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and displays the simul@@ ated changes without really performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder has been specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed by a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that were compared to that date will be listed .
if the scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ...
each file and file found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually shown together . you can open a folder by clicking on + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can be opened and all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open or fold all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of problems of this type again .
as shown in the above picture , colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical applications , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if their entire contents are identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradi@@ ct@@ ory file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradi@@ ct@@ ory file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ rough@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; directly after the merge copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the new file instead of merge ( un@@ lock ) is checked , then examines &amp; k@@ imper@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging will execute a file after the other . you state column shows Fer@@ tig when the merge was successful , and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file compar@@ ision method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode C is used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing becomes A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to ski@@ p over certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select Start folder start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to select only the current item , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if contradi@@ ct@@ ory file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that points to the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options to run , simul@@ ate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window opens ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select another directory merge and continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next record .
when &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; click on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to resolve the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before you proceed to merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them together again . even if the merge action was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; ( Set Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit to the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . there may be several patterns to be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig . * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig . * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by C@@ VS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a leading dot mark marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions will result in an endless loop and &amp; k@@ imper@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
( the number of un@@ solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders on a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the chan@@ gel@@ ation date and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default .
similar to familiar with the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this can be useful , for example , when copying the chan@@ gel@@ ation date . please use caution . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of assem@@ bling the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is switched off in the default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and will get the .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension , this will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge whole folder . this option is enabled in default .
usually the folder @-@ merge @-@ view remains visible during merge individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window into the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you may also need to merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the File Now File merge from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you launch the folder merge .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : read new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with KI@@ O slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ king . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date differs from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference spec@@ t@@ ator in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , it assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now you are comp@@ elling ) already exist . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use G@@ PL softwares for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go this way .
you have probably compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure inst@@ alls configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this actually actually coinci@@ dence but this is often the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost however , if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra file format that could save this information .
the effort has so far been too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; released and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors for high@@ lighting differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
see htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the root folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists thereof .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inser@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
only differences show : files identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re@@ read the folder with the refres@@ h function after changes to these options . )
only entries are displayed which show differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will likely change in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed again when you click on the button .
in default this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , change them or move them . this works both within a working area and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other desktop .
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager . cli@@ cked on , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and finish . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
when this check@@ box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop .
when this field is crossed , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .

when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the blank spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal display shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row , which is very good for the display lat@@ er@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as icons or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set @-@ up then select switch ... lets the dialog box appear .
currently it cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you need to login as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file , you need to register the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign it to this value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen motion . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact observation of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual imp@@ air@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
when you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fication window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in default , it increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a mo@@ ve@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is shown in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that this is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you are using the &amp; Shift ; click button or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can post@@ p@@ one the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rot@@ ate the image and much more .
starts or stops the display . stopping the update will cause the CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refres@@ h rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refres@@ h rate , the more CPU time is needed .
this mode displays a selection window . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set @-@ in short commands to save files , Open a new window , Print , Ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the kno@@ b document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and shr@@ ink &amp; etc .
k@@ mag is also known as a magni@@ fier ; it is a screen motion . you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; to use one area of the screen , as if you are using a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor holds a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and those of those mouse @-@ click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain generated by clicking the mouse and assi@@ sts so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also have pain caused by the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
if the intelligent de@@ bit activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this delay time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a click of the mouse .
if the intelligent shift is switched on , the shoot @-@ down time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before the mouse button takes place again , if no moving of the mouse takes place in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking the mouse shift . if this function is enabled , it creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider Sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the kno@@ b button , the settings will be reset to the last push of users .
the best way to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the automatic mou@@ sec@@ lick , you will later be able to post@@ p@@ one the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first of all , you should be aware at which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral elements of windows or at locations in the browser window , which do not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse j@@ acks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using intelligent shifting in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can end the operation by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can even click a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor over where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to have a keyboard input . thus , acci@@ dentally moving mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to use this way to copy and paste it into the clip@@ board or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the intelligent slide if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , mark text instead : drag at one end of the text area a mouse click and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this becomes every@@ time , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a click of the mouse . so you know exactly when when intelligent shifting begins the im@@ position time . later , you can use the intelligent shift even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . however , it requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension needs to be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; hold the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and who are pressing the pressing of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a drag @-@ process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to talk to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sets again spoken .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screenshot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text passages . from the text@@ book books you can choose often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you define the dictionary for words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only properly spell words can be recorded in the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a buffer memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
when you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sets you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken again .
with the menu item settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ zung as well as the page K@@ TT@@ L @-@ language service .
in the input field of the card @-@ card voice output , type the command to call the language generator . in the sel@@ ective field below the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding , with which text is passed to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you can find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications provide a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ L is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down action after selecting a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text passages or in the bar for text@@ book books .
the selected text passage is directly spoken with the selection of In the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered only into the input field .
with the second choice box Cl@@ ose of the edit window for text passages you can specify whether the text password is to be saved automatically when closing the edit window .
the book stores the book with the choice of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text passages will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passages are to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ zung contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ zung . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can select the currently used dictionary to the word @-@ to @-@ word .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection box .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . in addition , you can compare the number of words with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly inserted words automatically inser@@ ts into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vo@@ cabulary over time .
the main pane of the window to edit text@@ book books is divided . in the upper part , the text pass@@ anger books are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name .
add promotions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation buffer .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sections of the memory buffer .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is ordered directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu item is checked , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with hints on the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a mo@@ vable bar for text pass@@ anger books is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is located directly below the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
you probably don &apos;t have entered the command for the speech output properly or not fully . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for the voice output on the card @-@ card voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ TTS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eze file . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax does not like to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice @-@ over@@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; k@@ de ; further voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s .
since the language generator setting is only performed in the K@@ TT@@ L , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ L is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but that depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak , can print text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is saved , which the user can always re @-@ spend .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start the help : / k@@ mouth ) .

before you can use it , you need to install and correct program speech . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card is displayed General . see .
most TTS @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the speed dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to a number of printer expected queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the card reader speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card speaker will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already established appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear at the top of the list . the top speaker is used for the speech output if an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to move the speaker to the list below . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the card @-@ card General and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the TTS @-@ service of &amp; k@@ de is started . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map card orders to create and manage text jobs . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
tick this check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start succe@@ eds , the map card orders are displayed , and you can create text jobs and read it . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ L is stopped and the TTS @-@ system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ L ) .
when this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr automatically appears in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the preliminary read is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , break , pause , pause , pause , pause , stop and record text messages .
with buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ L was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check out voice output ( K@@ TT@@ L ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read before , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ stres@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the enhanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then tick the text that is to be read and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; are unique ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fying you about events you have set . you can also read and read the text of these messages .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful to improve the pron@@ unci@@ ation , to replace un@@ spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent specific short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters it is important to know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the reserved jobs will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ umed after the output of the warning .
messages inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can be used messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; greet someone who just walks the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text jobs . each order you initiate from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a application that uses text jobs . text jobs are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads it , this output will stop and termin@@ ate .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text jobs as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
string Transl@@ ators replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can either be supplied as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is provided with pre@@ defined string trans@@ lators like : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; include some X@@ SL@@ T files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with ballo@@ t selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card reader , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , it still gives the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not enabled and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the below follow @-@ up di@@ alog@@ s are displayed .
to set up string filter filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , it just has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text job speaks one of the languages registered here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl ; key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ y @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter Cop@@ y .
the string translation filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison to words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( whit@@ esp@@ ace ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alog@@ s or Edit as help to compile these expressions .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ form trans@@ forms &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such changes . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is att@@ ain@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
the speaker system allows you to send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card reader , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker &apos;s properties , which gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected and the properties of the spokes@@ man arranged on the card board .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the subscri@@ ber you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker optional filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mer can give their applications TTS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ L module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ L , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the speech output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility Website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output service via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands please enter
open two &amp; kon@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SAB@@ LE does not work at all . you also need to do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first make sure the character enco@@ ding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string fixing filter .

the language syn@@ thesi@@ zers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ code with &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can be downloaded from it . in addition , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ f under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
KT@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in one &amp; kon@@ sole .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information not yet included in this manual .
the speech &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to extend it for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , you need an up @-@ to @-@ date development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you receive the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ code , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , check first whether speech disc is properly working with your voice syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the sp@@ d @-@ conf file script .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the device of speech discs is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into single sentences . the user can leave a sentence or sentence , repeat , stop or ab@@ ort the output .
if an application contains text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender , it will be used , otherwise it will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you can see in .
if you click on the card reader to add a speaker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card card will be displayed . as an example , the device of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . you can find details on the modules below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you just need to enter festival .
select the character enco@@ ding for text passed to festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider , you set the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and display them gray , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of the K@@ TT@@ L , so that ( with larger memory usage ) the first set will be syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster .
if this check@@ box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on App@@ lic@@ ator ) .
if this check@@ box is selected , the program window kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is displayed when starting kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ L reads a text . thus you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card reader .
with the buttons in this row , you can pre @-@ select or return stat@@ s in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK all changes to the settings ( even on the other cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , instead , instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text jobs are listed and managed . editions of screen readers , al@@ erts and messages are not displayed . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ .00 % about the double normal speaker speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click App@@ ly to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out which device works with you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
on this card , you can set up special actions whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the issue of screen readers has been read , the retained contracts are res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning stops the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ umed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , the audio output is inserted into the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound and intro@@ duc@@ tory message is active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is played before the intro@@ duc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text entries . for messages , war@@ nings , and screen readers , there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card noti@@ fications will appear .
tick this check@@ box to turn &amp; k@@ de forward ; dis@@ abling noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; read no noti@@ fications .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications will be notified where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; mail@@ ed if someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . besides brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML is only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Con@@ figuration dialog are not set to 100 , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start reading text into single sets . thus , you can also start or stop orders in a manner on the map card , not the entire text order . this allows you to ski@@ p or stop orders in a manner on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you see the set @-@ box recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of rules for set @-@ up filters is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other set @-@ of @-@ box recognition filters , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn the setting up of the speaker selection by trying . switch off the speaker selection and select text for reading . check on the ticket selection again , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s choice changes . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
you can then stop text jobs on the map card orders or cancel , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set @-@ box recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for set @-@ up and add a tabl@@ ature symbol ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tabl@@ ature characters are automatically removed from the text before fil@@ tering ) . note that the standard set @-@ in recognition filter maintains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the standard defined boundaries filter by default , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the card @-@ card subscri@@ ber sel@@ ections you can over@@ ride the settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card reader ) . in other words , no speaker characteristics are specified .
using the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; these actors from . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most likely the originally set @-@ up properties .
select the method to enter the required subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the subscri@@ ber you want . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor when publishing the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is shipped in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker area , which is best suited to the following , click on the standard speaker button and then use the speaker that is best suited to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr won &apos;t show this voice .
add $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ int / vocals to add the new voice . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL where you found the voice to the developers .
on the card card audio there is a setting speed . to do this , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card card for speaking devices . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the talk speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) En@@ able either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML converter , and set up the talk speed .

Festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the code option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded by

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center are displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of network properties possible .
in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices to install &amp; Linux are installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempt to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited for distribution and rel@@ e@@ ading . by marking the non @-@ recur@@ ring setting , the setting can be set permanently . the next start of the network settings will then be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , change is not possible . in the System Administration mode , you can enter the System Administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interfaces tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network interfaces are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings displayed in the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... setting up in the device dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings display the dialog with further options .
with the option Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , are selected .
with the selection of Manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be checked .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole , you can see if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . turn on a switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch off the activated net@@ worked device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed , .D@@ NS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons additions or her@@ ders in priority .
clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution can be added a DNS server . it will be displayed in the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... Do the Edit Display dialog .
the list of named hosts describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for the Bo@@ oten when there is no DNS server available . in small , closed networks it can replace the DNS server .
normally the list contains a number of entries that are known to name , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . this version of IP still under test should be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add the New alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known machine has several ali@@ ases , de button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit ... Edit the Di@@ alogue machine will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately active in the system . in order to enable the changes , the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; kon@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de suff@@ ices ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all configuration files are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely dis@@ semin@@ ated . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point to assign a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used .
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own host ) .
the network address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this part contains the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if in the event of active DSL connections there is another content than fixed there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

to insert an environment variable , first one must be cut off or copied to the clip@@ board . only then , the P@@ aste is available at all . select the variable folder . then proceed to Edit paste .
to change a variable , select the variable to be edited first . then go to Edit Change ... Altern@@ atively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and change ... Select , or press C@@ trl ; O .@@ It will then edit the dialog variable in which you can edit the variable as described above .
to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then proceed to Edit Del@@ ete .
to activate or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it , and specify the status using the Edit En@@ able menu item . a de@@ activated variable appears under Description De@@ activated .
alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the variable and select En@@ abled . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or modified , you will need to save the cr@@ ont@@ ab . select the File Save menu item .
alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are only activated .
it appears the default k@@ de ; print dialog . if you select exit , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
prints the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the time sched@@ ules of the users .
a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the ability to store multiple archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar , which then presented the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , sel@@ ective emp@@ t@@ apping . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be involved by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; back the tape and reads the tape &apos;s pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the tape don &apos;t spell the spell on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ spell , searches for the matching index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be re@@ designed .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was inserted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
before throwing the strap , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; is indicated by a change of the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires to be format@@ ted before you can be format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy disks are usually prec@@ eded by format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives on the other hand do not .
after entering the band name and the capac@@ itance , continue with format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically included and ready for use .
before you hit the backup procedure , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local fil@@ esystem tree with a tick . only the so @-@ called files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup is started , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
tick the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the check@@ out process as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can start restor@@ ing , the files that are to be restored , have to be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the recovery process has been started , the Settings dialog appears . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the belt index@@ ed file on the basis of the tape file . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current folder where the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the newly selected folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only those files are stored on the same file system as the folder . folders , which are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
to determine what files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings above the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device node for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
if this setting is active , sends &amp; c@@ dat ; before the tape is inserted , the command mt load to the drive . with some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , when releasing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hard@@ war@@ dly block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with which host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file folder .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions , with which the protocol @-@ files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ Log tries to open the system log ; it will not display it , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely do not run with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found in / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected crit@@ erion or according to entered strings . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically , so that only the protocol rows will be displayed next to the filter . in default , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter search term will only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of step errors are displayed with a more con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color than protocol lines of the stage hint . the colored representation of log lines can be turned off .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identi@@ fier ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can use the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To new lines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option in the main window pop @-@ up menu to view all new entries in the log lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the window menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org. You find more information about the sources of sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the System V In@@ it quickly develops to the standard for the control of the program start at boot @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to change a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . this is why you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sys@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service you want to start when switching the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for the program in@@ it at different places and starts the first one finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab manually and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you will get it repaired by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it &apos;s an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the rest@@ art argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I might have a server run@@ level that only runs htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of the available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will not happen when you pull out an entry from the range of avail@@ ables .
note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . in order to merely copy it to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Edit from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection top or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired Run@@ level ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . use the tab key to change between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before exec@@ uting it .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are extracted from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine will start constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary intro@@ duc@@ tory programs of these distri@@ butions but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapters adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding tool@@ bar icon or save the save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled limited space limitations ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will be created , where you can make individual adjustments . other cards appear , if shadow passwords or / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the file card password management appears , if shadow -@@ passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd , are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears , if for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the space limitations are contained in KB :
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the file system with space restriction
the card card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs is found in the field Pri@@ mary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group Dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the matching button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ e@@ tion of the selected user or group will work analog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , remove , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
