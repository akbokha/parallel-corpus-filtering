<seg id="1">To translate the module website, you will find in the & konqueror menu. select the starting and target language of the translation from the list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the location of the entire URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make any important decisions depending on the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by the Babelfish page, where you can insert too translated texts.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier to use.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the map file tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the package kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package kdebase, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & konqueror; on extras crashes. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module overview filter (also called folder filter) can be accessed in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Options Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the document's root node, example: documentelement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects using the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in representing waxed folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree-maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder than the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized when viewed far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the marvel presentation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched to color mode, can either represent depth for easy recognition of the timbering depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is sufficient space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to occur. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">At installation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportionally to the size of the entry. with the Treportin & FSView, this target is not always respected. it is drawn as frames that are no longer available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for frames if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry is assigned to the subordinate entries remains the implementation. hereby, it is advantageous for the label and to avoid placing of space by frame, so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum laid area for an entry on the View View on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course each medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes a fast image editing with base image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in the 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management - workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; through the camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam, tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you are using this link, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is entered here. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailinglist of & digikam, and hopefully soon ask you to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site; visit the homepage to receive news about shared releases and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate, is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to register in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you & digikam, first start, you'll be asked where you want to store your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam, you will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digitih set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images, as a base folder. & digikam; view each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; dursucht recursively the library path in its entirety. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is the iste in hidden folders.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have any photos as icons. you can change them by using a random photo from the album and clicking this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you've configured the base folder, you can get in & digikam; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">The support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Panel support menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in sections Roh Decoder2 and Roh Working Time.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course each medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transfer to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a freely distributable software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. it also supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine. since photos are generally large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support. the Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support does not exist in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digikam, is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhoto Album, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images operates everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the tree, above the horizontal line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be put into keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to publish the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter will only be used for the fields shown in the symbol view. thus, the filtering works on the filename only if this ind symbol view is displayed. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the settings settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly to an album. select album Importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Importing screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by dragging or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select Properties from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped together under a common name. the collection used by you is used to sort your photos, when you choose to add or delete albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make it in the collections settings.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eldest, average, new ester: these set the date on that of the oldest, the latest image or that of passage of the album. to do this, first attempt to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; it is meant to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; Add as an album preview; in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be sealed.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual pictures in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you need to wait briefly while the thumbnails will be generated. you can avoid this by recreating all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the associated preview. what information this is, you can click on settings digikam; set up. select here the albums page and customize the preview image to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you allow the mouse cursor to rest a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the Introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all what it is & digikam. albums and Tags allow you to organize your photos in the way it fits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can reach all the functions that came with & digikam, possible via the context menu of preview or the menu image in the menu bar. you can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F4 Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... Select. in the digikam, image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. to do this, and how to adapt it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, other image editing programs may result in problems with the metadata that is contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image. this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select filming. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it will be moved to the dustbin of & kde; moved. F8 Photo Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslipquot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the date view, so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos that have been selected with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also collapse parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; collapse, so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">Keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported when losing the database as soon as & digikam; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New Keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this becomes the subtitle of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting deletion. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and place there. then a menu which gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword from the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select Add Album from the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To reuse & digikam, you must first add your photos with keywords. this can happen in two ways: once you select the photos you want to add with a keyword, you can click on the keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on preview pictures and select keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it assigned keywords. in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear in the main window under the thumbnail preview.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword by right-clicking the context menu of the photo and select removing from the keywords menu. the menu will show you only the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. thus, all associated images will be shown in the main window.</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is based on your definition files that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digikam. the approach to store metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and you need to know before you maintain something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you'll have to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; exporting is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for that content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving the metadata in the settings page of metadata in & digikam. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item from the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, & digikam, give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now select every photo keywords, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. it makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the next work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's proceed with keyword, keywords as you frequently call or categories in other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keyword, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or put the images to the right place. changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are from & digikam; updated while it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very coarse representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start seeing some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, associations, memories, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him through the motive that moves you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as a label. you can even export it for a selection of images. KDE also provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are innumerable and will be deepened in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels with images with geographical indications. & digikam, can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information should be stored in the setup page of & digikam, as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author line): associated with the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be the title like: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, this must be filled as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">If the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here, which you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change this, in the image embedded metadata. for private individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-pros this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. & digikam, will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate errors, disk loss, power violations, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, patch prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, common superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that went missing on the street or a fire. this kind of loss is the same which can also happen with traditional paper pictures or negatives. in this section we deal with problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll OnTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they must be dealt with cautiously and you can't wait any longer than a couple of years. of course you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archived quality which last longer, more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be readable, but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the correct way. the best DVD Recorders are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if they have just been written. therefore, they use a control checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which appears to perform wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged disks of damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format of the format against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recorder to high-quality media in a non-propriate format. likewise, read the data again to check you. likewise, do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: discos will stick to the longest when operating in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The faults are the most frequent fault cause, SMART may not detect these errors. some of SMART errors terminate the imminent failure. these are especially reading errors and shift meters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical equipment does not make a lot of electricity, it looks different for devices with computer chips and high-speed tests. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause severe damage. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current tops is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and avoids the rest. it is normally available in the form of a plug-in bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection then you should pay attention to the fact that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning impact and therefore protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection, which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coax cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specifically designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable power. it can therefore be useful to invest in a disruptive power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to save your data and run the system ordered. if you buy an UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity problems with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember all the cables before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are much expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB are cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB are cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are provided on photos. your free storage is available to you more, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 a year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very secure from the point of view of the data backup. transmission errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you open a photo one day. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems ever to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate intereferences within the data streams. in normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors on low levels and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms using the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">These two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. in case of notebooks, the amount of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the most. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been spotted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file wasn't saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders. this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 Megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result, the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB HDD is now available for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. so, do not worry about anyone else for data loss. so, backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything more dangerous than reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or resizing disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, one flash strikes you luck when the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">Disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, the patch prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighbour house, into your office or the like.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for data loss in spite of security is panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two times: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made. this backup comes to a versioning system closest to the exception that it is only dismantled and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that were really changed. this is done compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images right after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC data, retained XMP files, original retention, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and reevaluate while the time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backward. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility of changing a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc + dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software to read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG can be used as an open source standard for GIF. however, it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can provide relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (DEFLATE). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is already available for you and we hope that the competitors can use Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers drag it in front of an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive it. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine layer editing, you can use external programs. if you get the images again with & digikam, edit, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. just export them into web galeries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digikam. in the Adding a Photo to an Album you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use & digitising your digital camera, connect them to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file allocation for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the page bars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that not all information is available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notes, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the Selected button has been downloaded until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new download option is available. these images have not been downloaded from & digikam. in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons All for download or download Selected, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folders are sorted. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all by clicking the Delete All Delete button. if you want to delete only a few, then you have to select it first and use Delete Delete Delete out.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check whether the photos were successfully deleted in a & digikam; -Album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera body completely, you should do so about the camera system, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can result in double file names if you upload photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for database-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer, three more options open before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two will affect the data from the author in the Standard Auto identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% y-%% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. for further adaptations you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when you download it. or Uppercases, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digikam; uses for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of shooting to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section trim Metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, lets & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to disable automatic rotation, use the Advanced tab and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam, can use it to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in that case stores & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced tab and select the date based sub-albums at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select upload. the file selection dialog & kde; will appear where you can select the files which are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digikam; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means that a position is indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser to show the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam, users want to send a postcard to another & digikam site, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to store the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how come the GPS data into the picture? first, you should know that exii2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, articulated and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and finally about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsone or gpsbabel, but you need to save this data in gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geographic assignment module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and width grade or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the trademarks of hairy coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam, tries to give you as much control of his workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to set up in the Settings dialog; set up. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; note if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. even with database synchronization, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for writers: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this can be designations such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as these are the image of other & quot; provider quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC field. this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam;. these metadata is also available for other programs and can be imported into & digikam, without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded labeled captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the pictures. note: in images that already contain descriptions, they are overwritten by the captions.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor rests in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam will be tried, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & digikam; album folder that will not have any of these extensions, from & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset back by pressing the button Refresh to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lamp by & digikam, can be set on this page to the default values. each time you then open the lamp table, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the shown pictures. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be selected with darker or light colour in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the compression of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files option, you can switch the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality, since the DEFLATE algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">When setting lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy settings, the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata is not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it develops quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard annotation is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option, you solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the shinglights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pictorial, so the parts of your images are burned in, because of the inability of your camera to capture the highlights as well as transparent white. use the setting aperture white in the settings. the setting colors will trigger some unusual results, since it shows the highlights in various raisins. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the highlights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you choose to reconstruct the option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of & digikam; image editing. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should go conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the subframe data that many cameras have and that are available in color-filtered pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color-construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it creates color artefacts on the edges. it is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction correction, as you are carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to use them again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information how to translate color information from a color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Ask if an image is opened in the image editing / Start Color Administrative Module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Sets here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / icc or / home / user / .color / icc in which you save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profiles You have the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your images color does not paint the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently dcraw Gamma is not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof Profile that you can emulate as your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for. unfortunately not in the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon extention can recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work together with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these will then be downloaded by & digikam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes shutdown the metadata or from which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left a list of all camera supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire storage camera from the camera list. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out ob & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window menu. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the dustbin you can set the talk of & digikam; setting a photo in an album by deleting a photo. in the deletion of a photo and deletion of an album, you can find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly handled by & digikam; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the welcome screen by & digikam; during start-up, this accelerates the starting process from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start looking for new photos is forcing & digikam; the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos to look for. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, asks & digikam; you see if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to review and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on thumbnail viewing or selecting the item displaying / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam, so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, please refer to the image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing features of the image processing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should therefore create a copy of your image before you change it. you can save this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Restore menu or using the button The Restore Machine button Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action in the image processing can be undone or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit or Restore by selecting Edit Recovery from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the shortcut, Ctrl; -Z, and Ctrl; -Shift-Z for recovering.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB; on the backend or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a pop-up menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between are also reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the picture and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the startup menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">Full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you can use the Esc key. normally, you can view this in the settings dialog from & digikam; modify it from the & digikam, main window. see the section for setting up the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print image in the File image and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or whole sets. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select print Assistant from the menu album Exporting job wizard. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a page bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the inscription view, you can enter or paste lettering with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be truncated after 2000 characters and special characters will be re-formed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Applicator button or simply switch to the next picture, the labelling will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata to the files. however, this is always done if you selected a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword preview shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & digikam; session applied keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally the left sidebar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all displayed keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">If the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears, which asks you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper case the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is selected with no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog box asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or one, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced Search on all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the Groups button. the options look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why not listed picasaweb or Flickr? free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanners and the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the issue comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should I use another color space and thus have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click Info and then on information about RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callify my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to callify your monitor, because sRGB assumes that your; onitor works on sRGB, then you must either callize your monitor to the sRGB-standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before trying a further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, synchronize, Automatic balancing and contrast expand from the menu Corrigating Automatic Correction automatically try out of your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scars the luminary values over the entire picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparisons: this method adjusts the brightness factor of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity canal is as shallow as possible. thus, the result is very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic levelling: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light borders and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete history of the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhancement: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can lie too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which operates in 16-bit mode, your chances of correcting will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochem. they start it via the menu entry colors white balance of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original whitish screen again then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The target photos preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the top right is a histogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjusting lets you improve or dimming the shading details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are also set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the presets list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance that you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The presets button restores all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Here you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit encoding is better for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires more disk space, data time and is available only for PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, allowing you to use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects provides four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar arization, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when using a partially developed print a short flash light and subsequently inverted the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually generates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a reversed color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquire; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to increase saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools gradation and the simple luminous thickness / contrast / gamma, the tool toning correction is used to improve exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the slider area for the application in question. more concrete the three scrapers below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphene three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the knob and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box you can set whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is mostly dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic distribution is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tone, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadow, medium and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is visible in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later on. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images recorded with a digital camera, linear mode is the most sensual. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a broad beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cursor to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright shades correspond with darker output tones and become darker the associated image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see. if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change, a fitting line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you use this method and the three color pipettes, create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black white photo, which was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digikam; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer for image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you position it in the image a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: regulators for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness, as the channel blender then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color will lead to a visible noise coming from the farmy. farbros consist of small noise artefacts that don't appear at the same spot in the color channel and their noise patterns are different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion by reducing the color needed first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can save you for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel has been readjusted. preserving the Luminanz option is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is one work step, since color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (tm) jelly filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit coldness in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of a pressure of a pressure and the redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool frame add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. in detail, the image transforms with a colored line, Niepce renders it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative Inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text in a picture at any place. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any settings you have selected for your text can be changed until you click on the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool template, you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Picture template using in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions on size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam, submit an email in english to the & digikam; mailingliste digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you have to place your template folder in dialogue with the button base folder. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After set the root folder for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the templates folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the templates bar.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knob decreases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically adjust the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture blurry. actually, it does not work a bit, it works more psychosomally. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitization process colors with only minimal differences. elements that are smaller than the resolution will therefore be taken together to form a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more retrofit sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">For JPEG images a camera has been used internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness tool.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful, however, as the results do not seem very natural: sharpening increases sharpness of edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image refocus the tool. you can refocus on more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for softness with the menu item Corrigate softgel and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool for removing veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of radius or amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blurry mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats are created near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents as many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is the percentage between the original and the blurred picture added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thereby for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted from sharpening and hence fairness defects in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original picture is the (1) and the edited image (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to draw a picture to & quot; refocus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurry mask. refocus mostly achieves better results than blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular circuit works much better than the Gauß'sche fission. the Gauß'sche fission has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the swelling pixel which are far from the original pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß 'fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value should give 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will make the image even more polluting.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate. use this parameter if your blurry treat is sch. in most cases, you should let this value be zero to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocus parameter which you have set will then be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, eg. when JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could cause the unsharp masking to use a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. in practice, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurry mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has to be corrected with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator regulator sets the blur of the area darkened, in order to generate a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink bag allows for a modified colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool lacked correction is one of the most sophisticated tools to remove not desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the Preferences tab and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness about the image. weighting bigger values mainly homogeneous regions flatten and details sharp. note that the detail preservation should always be subordinated to the directional dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly throughout all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed just in one direction. if you have a movie grinning or CCD noise will produce a high value shaft-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best fixed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothening factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothness. set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise occurs, since it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle adjustment da [5, 90]: angular integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality that you receive by choosing this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Load are exactly that. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove picture flaws with Small Artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that wordel.Das Originalbild ist unter (1) zu sehen und das corrected Bild unter (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm from Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time needed for the filter per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore adjusted smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise tips may occur. put it to a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the picture. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothening process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the picture. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothening process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically roughened more strongly.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother if it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phasenjitter appear at edges. it can remove spikes and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the reduction of noise you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too cracking for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for softness using the menu item Corrigate softgel and experiment with the smoothie. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or afterward digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textures. the texture composition is performed with a different tool, the image error correction, and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / Frannkich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm he creates some compression & quot; Artefakequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any settings of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film grading on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts created by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially with high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and 'quot; bright pixel quot; in a photo with a dark-picture extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the darkimage button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and load it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interject these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square finish (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interject the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic finish (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interject the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is under (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corner, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise non-sharpening effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's film and color range of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can check the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light emitting at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, giving an optical filter with aperture settings of 1, or accidentally at a light intensity of 2, incre.Increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Adjust the brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction decreases the brightness of the pixel. you need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to re-adjust the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image editing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to one image. the original picture (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a correction of the lens and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the distant corners opposite to that of the second count. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general, this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree. with negative values tannular distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth grade. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter' has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value reates the image size and results in correcting the first count. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as standard values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best, perform this correction as the first. in case you re-cut a picture and then perform a tannular correction, the effect would be the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black vertices. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit menu from the image editing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from the front, frame and painting is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. keep in mind that when you hold the camera by hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of tonnenular correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film from the GimpGuru.org web page which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set of film grading and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add movie trajectory if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce some kind of aura in the highlights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; Filter film granularity is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce filtergrading on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film structure effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets loose from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity matches ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, from the other side, the hindiness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the edit is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooths 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon copy. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was marked in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows setting the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving Filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art using non-sharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: blurs the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a centre. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurry: wiping the image by turning the pixels at a centre point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance-blur: wipe the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion deflection: wiping the image through horizontal motions of the pixel. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Plasticizing blur: wipe the picture softly into the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shovel-proof: blurs the picture with random displacement of the pixel and thus simulates the unsharpening of a camera that is arbitrarily moving.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurry: find the basins in the picture and wipe it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool for making raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & digikam, image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">The original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it into the right orientation using mirrors or turning.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to the size uses a linear interpolation method to tweak the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam, uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was inflated by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the Tabs New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retaining aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the original image aspect ratio is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise occurs, since it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each entry for photo can be saved as a text file and then loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Blowing photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by adding a small color image to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just have to use the mouse only the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, create. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you left the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply clicking the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the Edit button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After cutting aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or landscape format. in the high-format, always the greater value of the height and in the cross-format width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Folding aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as standard values depending on orientation. the changed image data are saved in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setup help settings allow help to hide, so that you can put together your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-hedgehog, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a similarly harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower sheets of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden spacing at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden mean provides more liquid aid lines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third elbow, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition performs the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flux on this kind.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral mentioned above. its vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden angles are no uniform triangles. diagonal to place these lines can leave a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your pictoral focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The colors reflect and reflect verticale can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it's easy that you don't hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are shown in degrees. with the presets button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After filming an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is to use the function Transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically Cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after turning. note, however, the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Turn left at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Corner right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little bit dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shear tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shear, for example, moves the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can scatter horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shilling tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have completed the shear, the picture is wiped a bit. for a single layer this effect is mostly negligible, but two deposits generate twice as much blushing and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the picture has unearthed triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; shows only files in formats that knows. this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of it with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file is displayed in image editing. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam, supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures for digital images. redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read below Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF using the raw image converter from & digikam. in the section Configuration you will find further information on how to use modules with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports loading raw images only with the dcraw program, which is included in & digikam. this includes more than 200 raw file formats. all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coffin. below shows a short list of raw formats supported by & digikam; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. this clips are often saved in the AVI- or MPEG format. & digikam, but is no film editor and therefore has no built-in possibilities to display or edit films. if you click on a movie file, you can use the & kde; settings to play movies to start playback.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing need in & digikam; contain. your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softeners, noise suppression, refocus, blur masked, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; Textur applicable; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini-program. you can press out or zoom out and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this presupposes your images geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used for editing color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The palettes files that are installed by & kde can be applied either for the entire system or just one user. in the latter case, they are stored in your Personal folder for & kde; settings and hot user-defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Palette Editor, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line. it can be moved by clicked on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It indicates the color beside it. the color is described under the pallet view. here also the color name can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used for selecting. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor over there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box add Cursor under the button Color is enabled, the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor. the color is either inserted or skipped another; depending on whether the mode override was selected. this mode you can set by selecting overwriting under Beim Cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created in such a way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copy, cut and paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the proportions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line-end character in case another color is followed. if three numbers are in the clipboard, they can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit.</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="725">& graph-viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; include, are outdated according to the program author's & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraph-project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgrapher; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphviewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; on. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph is in & are; the graph new pays off and in & kgraphviewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphene in & kate; To open or open the graphs in & kgraphviewer; in one & two; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from around 1000 knot and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgrapher; is a & kde; program which requires the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the presentation of graphs presupposed. needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar will only open the icon file and open the (empty) list to open the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also remember your decision so that later. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphed file outside a running & kgraphed; instance open & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice to open a new & kgraphviewer; instance or display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">During the program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come to a page, are to be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Side preview with a graphene distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Save load page gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphers; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session. you can set a default behavior in this case (open the graphs in a new window or in a subwindow of the session already running) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the startup behavior of & kgraphviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or unlock the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which appears normally at a click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose from different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz; are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for orientated graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of orientated graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unfinished graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates for unfinished graphs a springbike layout. it uses the Fruchterman pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-wire catalyst for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm ranks the knot circular in accordance with the description of Six and tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should print the graphed file as parameters, and specify the calculated layout of the graph for stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms give special options, or even change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (directed or undefined) and applies the standard algorithm for each type at (dot; for orientated, & neato; for uncoated graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is checked, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new pictures from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select here the source of which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by changing the default ducrhe's own to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window will be displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After scanning the button scanning, you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the image file options. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots can be created after you selected the Import &gt; Screen Photo... menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photo modes:</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr lets you send photos to people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so you can sign up at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exporting to Flickr for two times, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. for uploading you need write permissions. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once after you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selector box. clicking the Ok button starts uploading photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during uploading.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Familly, you can set access permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module Galerie-Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Gallery Export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF's keywords and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo to localize. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS sign as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsone can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is done which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracks are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be recalculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below the data is brought together, the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for images you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolating and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the knob correlation to interject.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog box coordinates the coordinates from a call to the next, you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region in question and zoom sie.Add this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool for export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below you will see the Albenvorschau and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option for each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Reiter album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder where you want to write permission. a sub-folder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail image allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user as far as the action is. press Cancel to Cancel the Process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically end at the end to preview the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to look at a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as filming, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mausages. it was developed for quick image showing and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size is increasing, since no compression of the color information takes place. for example, this can be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image. the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look exiii to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool for converting a series of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can insert a base image transfer. you can also add an audio file in the mp2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. then you can create the module using Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images respectively the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the picture process is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let it black. the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all your preferences, you can start the production of the movie with the button.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW formats into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original itat from Him is: don't expect it to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraf!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion output. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images often or else you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata stored in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. use this mode therefore if you are safe, for example by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the albums.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can resize or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 diim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 diim.): resizing in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional scale changes in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-press: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo screen. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the most recently selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place them down to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Remove images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you selected are already attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not make sure to send too many pictures at a time. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After choosing comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are put together in a text file and sent the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted for lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in images file format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original digits data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option displays that the filename of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually break it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select make sure the pictures appear in a random order. so it is not used the order of pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. by chance, each transition between images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for placing an image as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have updated your pictures and videos with annotations, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; by these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, are now in each group, i.e. in persons, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you select people using the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the pictures are shown on which both individuals can be seen. by using this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person a thumbnail image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button that is located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view e.g. icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual. to do this, you will need to select the image for each individual. here you can select the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor to your liking and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you call the search in the main window, a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for creating the image properties. you can see this dialog on the picture once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string sequence in the label or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, however, are not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals but try out some functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; first start, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. after that, some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; view the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each box then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can preview the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in preview) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data, drag. if you select an area, you will only preview pictures of that period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images. one is in & photoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create using the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the look and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file is to be created on the overview page. see more information on export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that all pictures are from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can define how the HTML pages are to look like. most settings are clear, which is why it is not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 cannot download images that have for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, place the various folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. to enable the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the sub-folder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings just described have moved all three to basic folders and URLs. in these, a sub-folder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; then you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time spent doing this, you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all the images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and share this file so independently. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a two-fold way. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images of the URL that you have given when creating HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access through the File Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manuell option close to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & kphotoalbum to Automatically copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .kim file is otherwise very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import..., & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folder the importing images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named for your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the file to import are imported and which categories they comply with in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can synchronize the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump inside different picture groups & mdash; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will see the various steps of (1) laying down the information about your images, over (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced subjects and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhoto Album has been started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this handbook is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all of its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup using a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and uses them for future starts automatically. if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will see the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you can see six different symbols, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">You can also set up your own groups such as objects, animals or albums for each picture. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e., for example, set all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can see the settings available to you to specify the member groups. with the selected drop-down list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digilib and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by several applications, it may be that the modules with & photoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own images.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all pictures that show you the preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also pass a list of albums. here & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you specified in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums. for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do so, so if you would have selected people to view and pass this to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start Settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see the top of a menu and toolbar. under the toolbar, you can see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the pictures to show you an overview of all the existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image was taken, etc. you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">These are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can use them again and again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are depicted, you can, by moving the names used up, find the people more quickly and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting symbol by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case simply click on the images before and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have added several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Several items at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a group, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog's context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or sub-category. additionally, you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to sort it in an subcategory of this entry. attention, this presupposes that you can sort your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars, which form the edges of the frame, click and move. you can also create your own window by dragging it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button, which allows you to store the current setup and appearance of the window among other things.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a box. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and here window an / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with preview pictures of the currently selected images, or any images if you have no filter set. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture this is displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Edit menu. now the window will display you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; can provide you with a solution for this problem. you can also use & kphotoalbum; you can also use the pictures somewhere, thus & kphotoalbum; you can record the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are present for the pictures 5-9, so that & kphotoalbum; you can also preview these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy and repaste files from the folders. if so, if you want to avoid annoyance, such as browsing your images, please buy a larger hard disk to save all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the picture menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you filter the images that you want to make for others inaccessible and click Updated View shut down in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also use all the images that your little sister can see, control and use the menu entry All except for up-to-date view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to determine which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your little sister the laptop, simply select the menu entry images, so that all the pictures you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select the password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture-protection is by no means very secure. on one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves those who are not very familiar with & photoalbum; not very familiar to look at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; on a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. of course it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered about the image, such as who is on the image, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can easily drag it with the mouse and drop it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the appropriate entries for this display. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would have selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slideshow. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image can be controlled by pressing Ctrl key and plus respectively Minus. started and stopped the slide show by pressing Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag in the image and zoom out. to enter the zoom, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button, you can zoom out the zoom button in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the key button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zoomed. with the equality key, zoom the zoom, so that each pixel corresponding to the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they are in and out with the plus and mini key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current image using the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it may happen that you'll find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. in the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you will probably prefer to mark only the picture and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to add images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pushing the corresponding letter. see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available in the browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just put all of them at once with notes. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you show categories in Show view, then you can add character to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you can paint & kphotoalbum; painting on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not stored with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; turn on the picture from the context menu. to end the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties and the object in the wire model views is yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all the objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click either on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the insertion menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can remove selected objects from the scene by deleting either from the Edit menu or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the Path to & Povray; the user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">If you want to render only part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below one view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map of the map to the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from anchoring, drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the top left in the fascia bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the fascia bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window order... store it. a dialog appears where you can store the window orders under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon in the toolbar icon or select View Scene View menu.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or select Render Modi in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each rendering mode has a name. you can type any name, it makes sense, but it is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the cross section subsection and enter the image editing window into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the characteristics, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the User Manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moira pattern or incremental effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and binds & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. the default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is constantly re-split and adaptive because the rectory depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain number of pixels with super sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predefined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually followed and checked for further division. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that creating noise for the ray process, called jittering. if you switch off jittering, change & Povray; the rays at a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust if the alpha-channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a POVRAY file, select File Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command line of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing error messages, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; to import objects into the scene, simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can paste the source text for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. place the path to your documentation and the version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identifiers.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object start of the points on the Grid in the contextual menu of the wire model views. here you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail fidelity for advanced projections, all the wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature creates a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a ground beneath the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge of the edge, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more accurate information about the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window orders section explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field Standard window Order: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The existing window orders show all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the selected window setting. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card board you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultlessly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window orders:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu item. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry called camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the camera's basic settings, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the camera's point of view. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the user button or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change instantly according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. you might, for example, insert a header (insert finite body quad) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or Enter. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the level as well, even at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you will notice that you can open the item for the bottom if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case you will only find the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should postpone the floor to exercise one unit below the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters. choose Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted. please select First Floor. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matte black material, because you still need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see color on the header and ball in the preview, click on the Apply button and then call the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you want to render your picture now with one click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the colour list, you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the property tree you need to insert two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select each time monochrome and change the colors in the object's view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step, as you should have understood the basic mode of operation of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the user to press), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you have moved the floor by one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface looks like a matt black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material. as already at the bottom, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Underobject and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on ball pigment, then choose Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to set some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen shots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a rendering method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that render the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog impact. thus, the scene is processed pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restore the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu item if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last return command. this menu item can only be selected if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window orders and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option pre-set shortcuts for & kpovmodeler; modify or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to pre-use rough surfaces without having to be able to model any bump on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file both for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give color to the surface of an object color on pixel base by applying a picture file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window, or if all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog box - & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, General and Processing and Diashow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; in the two other, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts can be specified for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected then the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, loads & ball show; already the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kuickshow; when ending the name of the last opened folder. at the next start, & kuickshow opens; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bars to select a background color. it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the image, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuettshow; to set up only some of the file types that the program can also display.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You can set up your existing multimedia buttons to function as & Amarok; short commands. this will make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Amarok's DCOP interface has many common functions, mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use kdialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data using Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should include any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow to run external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all ongoing scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and store the setup data, each script itself needs to take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok puts the workfolder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is piled up. the script could now & zb; use DCOP functions to retrieve more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: Submenu itemTitle Path Contains the path to the selected files in the playlist, if a custom menu item is clicked. in order to add an entry, you can use the DCOP Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminated, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. cleanup work. this includes saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarok's script management can also install script packages that the user & zb download from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar Archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend a archive name such as myskript.amarokscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok-script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the introduction of amarokscript. for this reason, you should correctly designate your script packets.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the wiki Script page of & Amarok; Apply. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you might also search only a very specific title from thousands of your collection. with & Amarok; 's collections browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You may have some playlists, but you can never decide which you want to listen to? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. these and many more useful functions make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>

<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date piece during piece changes causes the playlist window to roll down / roll to keep the current piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context-browser, the context-browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is piled up.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the appearance section you can customize & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the Fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; use the otherwise grey described section through marking of own fonts. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is used, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the font type for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for typeface and background. clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selections. if selections are not used, the pre-set & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text entry field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering space holders the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to determine which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD is supposed to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card-card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate further settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; to browse for music files. in order to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the displayed as well as their sub-folders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists in your collections folder (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the playlists automatically added will then appear in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down box driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further installation is necessary in the MySql installation window.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql file is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under calculator: the calculator is entered where the database is located: the network port is entered, under which the database is reached. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data needed for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card card last.fm addresses the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece as needed.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces to refresh the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no further KDE packages. you must have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to get rid of kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, presuppose that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will make trouble for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the taglib library for days. you can locate the file by following in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developer on bugs.kde.org and then append the broken file that caused the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for it in & Amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries compiled with the same compiler version. if Z. B. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, taglib but with GCC 3.3.X compiled, this leads to crash when processing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate autom. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the email will automatically open during a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the bug will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but do not mark this as a Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl die "The file $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously to output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. sblive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in the search for the problem cause and solution. for GStreamer you may need to indicate another Sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media need to be decoded first. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you want a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decoded it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag and paste records from the collection browser into the playlist. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save them to the playlist right away. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection, and you have the option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select the audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format. drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button playback.</seg>

<seg id="1330">The burning feature is also available in the playlist. just right click on an entry and follow the burning menu. here you have different ways to burn a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed which make work with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to any other. the playlist window contains several browsers that can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok can be used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current running track or current stream. just below is the area, the game time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch through the available analyzers by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the runtime display there are also the buttons PL and EQ. the knob PL is activated or disables the playlist window, while the button EQ is used for setting Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window is composed of the play buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the play buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer checkbox, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many functions that there are in no other player. but don't let the fullness of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be split into two main areas, on the left hand side of the navigation pane. in the navigation section you will find some of the excellent playlist functions, such as the context browser. on the right hand side, the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later still be explored in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you might notice that the window has been dropped off. the information shown here is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; furthermore, the information can be collected in the statistical window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music displays information about the current piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to see the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the images can have any name, but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information is to be displayed in the music subwindow. right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the interpreter, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok, try to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be saved in & Amarok; s collection database. there is no running text script required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search to google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only grouped the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - At first, the pieces are arranged according to the performer. if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sort by interpretation and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are alphabetically sorted among each other. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / performer - your pieces are sorted by genre and among them by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This attitude works just like the above, but is additionally sorted on album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically capture your collection once you own something at the selected folders. if you own lots of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes about using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, from the last 24 hours to a year. in addition, you can also select your complete collection, so the filter is practically disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This displays the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the current order in the current order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transmission to the media player. see the Media Player Browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn on CD - Due to the selected pieces are sent to K3b and either burned as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for pieces information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files to the dustbin... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, after which it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Synopsis - Changes a compilation of marked album back to a normal album. the album will then no longer be displayed under different interpreters but again among the associated interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to handle many playlists, including Smart Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically generate some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Smart Playlists are possible. click the Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intelligent Playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow will be used to connect & Amarok; to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod you need to be included in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpret sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the required tracks from the playlist and let them drop on the list Interpret. if you are done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transmission is complete, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive bandaging for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL. if you type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can access music from there in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply drop down. in that case, the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: thereby dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces attached to the playlist. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter characters, only the pieces are displayed, which contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by whitespace separated search terms, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter one or two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">When you enter between the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you would like to search for entries that contain spaces, then wrap the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be sought after entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you may also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that doesn't contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax versions as you wish. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the selection sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then click on the entries with the right mouse button. the entries will then have a mark with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left side, you can find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar, there is a unique, magnified analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for toolbars, for example playlists and volume control. you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbars there...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. in addition, the status of random mode and retrieval can be changed easily by clicking the mouse twice in the respective display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry opens the window visualization plug-ins. there you can choose the visualisations of & Amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">This entry hides a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can launch it by choosing actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your great suit in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you set a piece into the queue, the playlist will display a number next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the plays will play: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">The queue management will open you through the queue administration. if you want to add a piece of the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also easily add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already given (the details to set up this follow later).</seg>

<seg id="1413">Adds items based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need any Last.fm profile so that this dynamic playlist works.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click the playlist you want, drag them to the playlist window or right click on it and then select Load. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new one. so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of mix and playlist mix immediately fill out your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlist recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece of your collection. the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: dynamic mode settings. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu item.</seg>

<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars of & k3b;. when an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view features an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows the selection and drag of files to the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for & k3b; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can change the mapping association settings below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup assistants. thus, the correct permissions can be set for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general programs can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work on startup. this dialog is intended for personalization and for fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with one & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task are key to which the muting programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you are using the dcop command line program. to make use of the DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following in the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; program, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Int createDataProject () DCOPRef createDataProject () DCOPRef createDataProject () DCOPRef createDataProject () DCOPRef createDataProject () DCOPRef createDataProject () DCOPRef createDataProject ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created Project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project about the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject Through using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void addUrl (QString name, QString node) void addUrl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString newname) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This allows you to fill in a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; output for & kde;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in wav files on disk) and by many encoders encoding these WAV files (these encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoder packages can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and stored into WAV files on the computer (lossfree and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per titles) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoder needs to be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to destroy any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device removes the protection, it is not possible to deal with the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid buying copies of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called up as often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily use to read a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the page step by step example, there are more information about how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">If the CDDB request the CD-data on request in the CDDB register (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of encoders available so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. it must be noted that previously the encoder in the code settings dialog was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already selected file is selected for coding rather than a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, ports) for program events (such as read & CD; expired).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for setting the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can restore these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences become less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality in deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG player devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate of about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate of about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and autostereoanlagen. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overstated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information collected manually or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be transferred / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of programs for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help with the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and title needs to be added to & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer. it must be noted that only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note from the translator) I'm not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information publicly available on the & CD; and in addition, the information without the & CD is more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select an address (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This may only be the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org gives an up-to-date list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more about it, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first once this has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the extracted wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be found on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about encoder can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the encoder installed.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading genuine on it and if both cdparanoia and audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD. to do so, check the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to it (eg; by trying to copy a bit into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator, something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each recording & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compressing the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program to use the freedb to download the CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any time of reading a & CD; change once the right settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here you do not have much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only In case of incomplete information, please select, so that you will be notified when details of generating keyword (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down selector is easier, becomes a & CD; entry is found, starting immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually input everything, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use it twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in the offline mode, the two selection panels must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is a freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD should get? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will function as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as there are many firewalls running the protocol 8880 standardly, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send & CD; data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">The number at the same time: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one available drive? parallel reading and encoding? the author does not know it, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to discard the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget that folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be blocked to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be encoded at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to decode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we just have the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; terminated. this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you chose the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs to the hard drive. we will set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the preceding section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up, as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process described in this section must be repeated for each read & cd.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screen shots look somewhat different from the data you have received from freedb. therefore you will learn the & CD; manually insert data instead of fetching them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet happened, then the & CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search in the section Questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully obtained from freedb, all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; a window will be displayed, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the checkbox for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD-data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "the artist no longer has to enter" "" "Current Title" "" "in the input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words are beginning with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the encoding settings tab; take a look at the 'Basic settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also re-create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help for the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD; this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information, go to the freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you return to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the pieces of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the freedb data. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the pieces list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are selected. a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece, or click the All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When you click on the selection button selecting the selection process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears if you are trying to work with a codec you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, read and code in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding. in case of low-performance machines the result is unclear. the used computer with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of, however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people compiled from source files, and not for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variations of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshot of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any locking point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is considered the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; if you want to add or change something useful, let it do. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strangely, if you managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you do not need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and caraokespieler of & kde;. besides others, he has also some features with real-time graphics and karaoke and real-time highlighting of texts.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also supports & Linux; Ultrasound Projector, which is needed for GUS maps.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag & drop; any MIDI file from one & konqueror; -window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (property events or text events). kmid is automatically retrieved by the method used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">When you start playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS maps (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from an & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Displaying button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, so interrupts playback. press the space button while no play is played, starts & kmid to play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics or other both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically retrieved which a song is used so you don't have to manually set anything manually. so if you want to select automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text is automatically selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the font properties and / or property events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these will be played after the series. in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the collection under the Organizer menu. click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. at the beginning this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can choose the desired collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection is not stored. remember that if you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection by opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then add the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequence of the menus collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue a song, select the next song button, next song from the menu item, or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the Previous piece, the previous Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map of General-MIDI events translates into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, you don't need a MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS maps, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file containing all the required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary for each occurrence to have a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">"" "define PATCHAL... END" keymap "" "" Name of the keymap "" "..." END "keymap" "" "A further keymap" "" "END" "" "END OPTIONS... END OPTIONS... END" ""</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future releases of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60) that sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it picks patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term Trommel-Patch of the patch, where every note represents a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas, etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as is the presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names on the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussion channel. see for example the keymaps provided.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need 16 or 9 channels).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the N channel. if you use the keymap option, the keymap with the name name for that channel is needed. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on that channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is determined in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal commas are available).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you must try a little bit with & kmid to try.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find it in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob doesn't light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the Point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't compel anybody, & kmid to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid to have. that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agrees to support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First enable automatic add-on to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I've got on a & kde; Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a karaoke file (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, I encourage myself to program more on & kmid to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm in the third year, so I do not have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take some time for me. as a hobbies, I have program, collect MIDI files, make music and prove sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download midi / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anybody. I would therefore like to emphasize that I'm only further programmiere because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - fixing the bug that the pitch was too high at AWE-Cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, correction or even just a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid can also be found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and view images. you will also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE-card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid to compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used for playing video files from MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet than & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the website The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links below the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchical level. if you want to print an entry, your group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and permanent playlist can also be changed using direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected with playlist from the menu and either select Edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing mode leaves or another group is selected without the same as the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and closing can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; img dur = "Invert" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / gt; & lt; / smilgt; In the directory tests / some examples of SMIL will be supported by & KMPlayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like setting up the backend via mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even be added to the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & KMPlayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file Assets of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a given backend for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if this was determined), this must be done by manual modifying the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be used, the device and the TV channels need to be configured. this can be used to manually edit the scanner from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (video data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog is to be used in the Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, Xvideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux expansion needs to be functional for the XFree86 server. for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hint how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to run as user root after the device is inserted. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom on the CDROM drive shows.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts slowly, why does each time my CPU need to be checked for its performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhaut. kxineplayer automatically needs the last stored value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry about this. it is only a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Cile; as well as other source text editors - the upliftment of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & Kile; if you see green areas of a green text on the screen, it is most likely that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic fulfillment of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically generated a blank line (for input of the text) and the associated line to the closing of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the MenÃ ¼ Settings Kile; LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are normally divided into several elements. & latex; allows subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph that is the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse-click on the respective object.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files may be very helpful, as soon as a DVI; file is created, jump & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the respective line in & latex; -Source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the return search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element was clicked in the DVI; file, the exact opposite of it is applied. as soon as a section in the & latex; source code is clicked, the corresponding section is sprayed in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified with other work.tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set for project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-build: the & latex; source is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there is no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file can be changed to Ã ³ nderungenâ ¬ remotechâ ¬ remotely and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When looking at the Edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be found. the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for fast structure of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is available for items such as keywords, joint notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Description: with this command, a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified name (choice of a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ llReference e is used for defining the font size. it enables the font sizes to be set for the main text, the joint banknotes, etc., the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Cile; two options are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use MenÃ ¼ s Bauen or Knopfs Schnellbau.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Cile; the storage will automatically expire.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. if this is not the case, it should also be taken into account when logging in. if this is not the case, it should also be noted.</seg>
<seg id="1780">Environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document. for example, a report with Font sizes e 12 is created, and only a few notes should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ shapand\\ end {environment} will then add the opening of the font depth (l).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are superimposed only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, intensive pressure, submissions etc. can be added. these commands end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the intensive printing and is closed until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"" "after the background for writing the source text with the" "" "& latex" "" "sign language is shown, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile is followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once the wizard has entered a bit of text, a few adjustments should be performed for better readability of the document. to this end, a quote, a few places in the grease and intensive pressure and a poem will come to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document was viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl-E can be returned to the editor (the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a PostScript; / PDF file. just try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent fileformat (engl. d e V ice I nologies). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing of a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document through file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into dipped other formats can begin using the toolbar in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The previous search allows the direct jump from the editor to the left position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Cile; offers a corresponding adjustment for all & latex; binaries. to do this, only the Modern can be set up under Settings Kile... Tools upgrading will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">The mouse pointer has to be positioned in a line of the source code and can be clicked on to select preference. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; doc by & Kile; specified and sent to the corresponding line. to do this, & Cile; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (configuring the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using the rapid build of the & DVI; do not open, an error can be found. if an error occurred, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file has the error source in the source code. in the editor you can then use the previous LTeX errors and NÃ ¤chester LaTeX errors for jumps between the errors. in order to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to choose the template to be used for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used for quick creation of a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent user of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates can be written, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be open or create a new file. & Cile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... settings can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering document class. typically, it is used as such:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have to be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template should be searched by one on the Internet and can be executed under the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & therefore unique; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighted by many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings can be made directly from & Kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & are, and to learn its possibilities, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Cile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Cile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be accessed via the menu Help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the & tex; that means that in this way click\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can capture additional jump marks. this is a separate type of bookmarks inside the text. the menu items edit jump marks or the corresponding button are highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Close;. although & are unique; important functions for writing a & latex; source text added; & latex; include always many environments and groups, and therefore supports & kile; special commands for selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with plain lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word below the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command can also be selected at the end (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Cile; offers with its own commands for faster access. editing Remove are the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit excerpts paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further commands under editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the outline of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of nested environment commands, quick overview can be lost. this command completes the last open environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Cile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those in the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the sharpening clip.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the sharpening clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the sharpened clasp of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of screwed-sharpened groups-clasps quickly the opening overview can be lost. this command completes the last arranged group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two easy reference marks are used as an entry string. for the purpose conveying realization, the character is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two easy reference marks. also for the end of the support the sign" is used. & Kile; knows this case and creates two closing signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic system of double quotes can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french), so that German or French suits are used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pushing Shift; Enter & Cile; a smart line break. if the current position is located within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, the line closes & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an attached line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be configured under Settings Kile; LaTeX can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to assign the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et-characters (amp;) to each other. & Kile; try to reach this. if this tabulator is not possible the left tabulator in the current column.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already a good source of source content offers, it was added in & Kile; for special precepts (mostly for & latex;). three according to need and the other two are configured for automatic adjustment. all these modes can be set for different ways of working under Settings Kile... fully adjustable.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is added using the command\\ begin {surrounding} and kile; automatically add the\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last character of the input will be removed and possible to set up the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be smaller by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, from & Kile; also jump stamps can be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of Edit Detection marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Cile; Enable can be done to these lists. you can select different padlists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher des Allgemeinen Sprachkreihs auswÃ ¤hlt.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the enunciation of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the invocation mode will have a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for fulfillment of environments is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete mode, the menu editor or the key key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically included and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key will be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile knows that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; Set up... tile; Enable can be done to these lists. this mode uses the full list of Total Preparation mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Cile; support custom lists of copies, which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Close can be fully set up. as an example of a check list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, is included in the entry L =\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the menu Edit or the word processor Ctrl + Alt Spacebar is replaced, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>

<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus;. all these tools apply as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as a base. the combination yields fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation knows myproc and how outstanding it is. if we lift it a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no more dependent on a terminal; simply clicked on and done the symbol for the XML processor!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects an index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is in the geduous work folder, then release the current working folder. if not, then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder field.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files are deleted every time myproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said, everyone who has worked on the & kde; -documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the recently opened file is index.docbook, then simply select the current folder. if not, select up-to-date working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; download, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. by doing so, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can benefit from additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait for anyone to use the desired in & quantaplus; the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a KPart, we begin editing the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog enables you to manage and add all contained plugins. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location & quantaplus; this path for searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project involves several people in a kind of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose himself from the list of members of the team who he is. this happens by looking for the team member from the list and pressing the button as suppressed. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold to which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and hiring of one's identity are important in terms of news and notes. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of your team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into the CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. addressing can be a team or sub-project leader. see how such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To add comments is simple. it can be selected either the note item from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comments text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with the nickname of the nickname of the team member, is a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject leader After the Area and Subproject leaders, the corresponding area or sub-project names should be given as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roll names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for script and formatting languages, the DTD-agnostic is supported and webbased formatting and scripting languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible from the Settings menu. here only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the other can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using settings Quanta... called. this dialog extends over a few pages that are dealt successively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means, the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically close: if checked, will be inserted for tags, for which the closing day is optional, that immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and end tag: when switched on, the appropriate tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for recognition of different types of files. the default values can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than file opening files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped), but this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized. this setting here, however, is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates periodic backup copies, so that a power failure or crash during the next startup of the program can restore the document from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a cardboard box), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings to the default back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come together by modifying MDI modes and andocking / depending on views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages section is used to control the display of warnings through hooks of no longer questioning.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source-text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the illustration of the parser node in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action dissolved by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure tree configuration, the visibility of nodes in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep during a change in the structure tree. empty nodes are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The section to specify abbreviations (a kind of templates) that can be unfolded in editing to more extensive text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means that there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed. plugins are non-part applications from third side, which can be reused by any KPart-capable application, the most known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not at a standard location as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin when starting, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "component in" "" "read-only" "" "mode: check if the plugin refused to load. only Read-Lese-KParts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the given information is correct. select the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the bug search was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a matching debugger plugins in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables is displayed. appears usually in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all stops, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that displays the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, anything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger if necessary, or it shares the plug-in to listen to debugging requirements. this action is fired by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger so that normally it is not necessary to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Start the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Tells debugger to start executing the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution is continued. happens before a Debut requirement is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger to start executing the script without transmitting information to monitored variables and the current time number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues. happens before a request is made, the execution begins when a request is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible if possible in functions and include file.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Rejects the debugger to go over the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variabla view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you & quantaplus; can adapt to your needs and how you & quantaplus; can help you get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for up- and script languages as well as CSS; they allow & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages and & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folders and toolbars. tag folders are handy, symbol-oriented hardest of image buttons (above the edit window), the text and instructions more quickly insert into a document as a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog, den & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable fast insertion of tags to a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all is necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. that is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this item can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of attribute. in addition, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Gives the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface inside & quantaplus; is used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a pattern name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tag%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together the elements of a list. it can happen only once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag can happen only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each attribute; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Indicates the position and size of a field in dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each and lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tags defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with one & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is above in & quantaplus; window to start and check over TagXMl. another dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is only done when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Below is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.day.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Below is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file an & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returncode = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tag &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for using DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited by diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries are created:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = solstice 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings action... created. click New action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned shortcut. by clicking the Userdefined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the Quick start -Dialog or the various see in... actions for (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. in this way, try to find the script at the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text will be added to the PID-number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script enters & quantaplus; to accept the default input. in the input field input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages, which are to be done with the text written on the default output.</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in a given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. choose Settings action.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, activate "Edit Tag" dialog when available to allow an input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we & kiconedit; use. select from the & KMenu;, Graphics other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered loose, stiff, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; day in the current document is added.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be associated with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions set... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functionality to toolbar, or you should set it to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar to set dialogs on Settings toolbars. make sure the tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (all on the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by trying all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the right folder. after NeeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be saved in the right folder. please adjust their file toolbar (s) to be loaded when a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scripting language or formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be in & quantaplus; Repository check if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # Elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.3.html Tag1 = tag1.html Tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that is used to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context-aid, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that are to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML-documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but be proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. in different places there is a With Email Print menu item, such as DTD DTD Package (DTEP) with email, ship toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. to make an effective contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private gpg key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can stay empty) and with clicking OK the upload will start.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears to indicate the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages that are not currently supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day XML format. there is the easiest way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definition line: the string that appears in the! doctype tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; can be adjusted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and to draw full benefits from & quantaplus, you must first familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; use, available. from toolbars to actions, everything that is marked global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in a global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emounds the joint use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the board companions with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the mouse on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all the file riders, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click on the editor pane introduces a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as the basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tags on the mouse pointer or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; pgt; insert into your document, then click on the symbol representing the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box of different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and roam. in the presentation with card managers are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be done using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website, etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information from a script. by clicking the right mouse button, other functions are available, such as start the script, edit, or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document's position on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands is opening in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, maneuverable attributes and namespaces can be changed. the application system oriented to the contents enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cards at the bottom end of the window, which can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This packet shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This FileManager shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -Scripts executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbars is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed tarpiece archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save and load them in & quantaplus; as any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of your bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a close idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer in pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why Developing what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; rumour is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to dramatically increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta execute).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and maintained by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later usage. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; -prescribing so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -Selling which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; -script error messages are given!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Activation and activation of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one switches to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a single click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; -Projects will be stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows, for example, to copy video files to your project folder or sub-folder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved by setting actions... to be added. toolbars will be saved via toolbar toolbars, or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load one & DTD; which you or anybody else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP. if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu default in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or disables the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting using toolbar is denied if this day contradicts the rules at this location.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on it. click on an activated plugins off it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available hermenhebungsschema depends on the unique; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on selected & DTD; using external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes takes time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode corresponding to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect every application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars or which can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed most from top to bottom, for example after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project project characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, the file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except you handle local data. either a name (hostname.example.com) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log are used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static content that you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the folder are displayed and you can make a detailed selection of good thinners.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by check hooks or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the subwindow profiles or Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible) which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the selected debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed can be selected. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in this, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In sub-window profiles, high-load profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by showing its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event's sub-window, you can switch event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a certain event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you cannot influence this behavior at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. open dialogue project is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behaves equally, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the right mouse button pop-up menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the highly loaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button ends to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be stored in the kernel memory and forget it for programs. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is required and the rather unsafe password stored on the disk does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. in editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the project or project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to work on one's own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars are in & quantaplus; best with the menu toolbar. use and addition differ. adding toolbars will be treated at the bottom in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the icons can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, it can remove other actions such as toolbars, rename toolbars or set up toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog, which actions to be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action labeled, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bar... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template. templates have in & quantaplus; in some the restrictions you imagine for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some templates supplied with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binary. binary templates are normally found in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specialized documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">These templates are useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents, based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-base.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As a template save As local template save....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template for project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: copying the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop or paste via the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the project file tree view to a folder on the right and create site template, type a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very goal-oriented approach. you can provide headlines and footers, or dynamically with & PHP; create, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">Template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is terminated as soon as the parent attribute has been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template chart. if a root folder is configured so, templates would appear in this path basically, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-block. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or updated text for templates in this folder. these could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the matching headlines / footer rows in a folder with custom headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the context menu (pointing right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second mode divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to source code if necessary, in which the implemented changes are visible in the VPL; editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; a small green icon depicts the VohandWin of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. with pressing F9, this mode is already active, the key print activates the active cursor from one window to the other, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation interval between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable in settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL, you can select between synchronization by one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small Spanne for fast calculators and a large Spanish for slow ones.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to mitigate the pendulum.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click in the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and choosing the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves as usual. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted through typing and deleted using back-button or removing key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that the insertion of tags does not remove existing identical tags, e.g. when a anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed from any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars, such as the table wizard or the lists assistant are disabled. you will later work in the & VPL; in this release the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kDiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kDiff3; could show differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to dissolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps with the comparisons and merging of complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no longer if nobody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder ner2 folder ner1 Folder 2 -o Target folders kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 -o Target folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open-Dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the open dialog shows your selection and displays them next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the file blank, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the folder Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons respectively merge of folders will be introduced. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When assembling is checked, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to set a output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the comparisons / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison will start immediately. in the open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would only need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't get out of & kDiff3; only the drop-down of text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, the color indicates which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + + e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that divides the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. when the line break is activated, the line is displayed in refracted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has an Info line with the wording output:, the filename and [gev] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons to find the next solved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also indicate a jump in position in the windows where the first line of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing, no more line is left in the group; this is only a placeholder for the event that you may change your mind and perhaps select another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a mark that you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the images and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, high, down, side, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the august window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insertion key you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Aufwärts / Ctrl-Picture down) or the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. however, be careful with this option, because you could accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-feed sign\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line ends of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of most recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and revert to the next startup. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected font does not support this image, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered ascertained. on these systems, the presets button automatically creates an uneven color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pushing the tabulator button. otherwise a tabulator characters will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press a return or return, the indentation of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each option is automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At comparisons of files, & kimper3; first to find all completely identical rows in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. in this step white signs are ignored. even when merging, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a number of wagons'\\ r 'and a line feed'\ 'at the end of one line, others only store a line feed character, but then files with different sizes in the page-on-page comparison will look identical, but like a white character. if this option is checked, this option must be disabled. in default this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in the default setting. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is activated in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic skipping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before moving forward to the next unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Trigger automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white signs in many files are less important. if you only use this from time to time, then use better the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also affects conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and messaging of merging. look for details under documentation to directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, then the original version is appended to the suffix .original. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without further fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to stop & restart; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is terminated globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding a short notice is what local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessor command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this to suppress codes of changes in white signs in the text or supervisions. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences will be shown in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. depending on the selection of A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be shown next to the normal yet another oversighted column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just end the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Assign the comparative windows next to each other or over each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your needs.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used to input this preprocessor command. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessor command for line comparison to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\)\\ U\\ 1 / 'The. * is a mercenary expression of the characters found on each string. the\\ 1 in the translation string refers to the found text in the first clamp number. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, a pre-processing command is required for line comparison: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another preprocessor command for line comparison suitable. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the composition from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl only needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and merging. further operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-up preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text is altered or hidden, you may not accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and displays the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merging of single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder has been specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not merge. to start merging, you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed by a small message window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files that were compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and file found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually shown together. you can open a folder by clicking on + / -, or double-clicking on the object, or clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the folder menu contains two functions All subdirectories can be opened and all subdirectories can be opened with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical applications, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if their entire contents are identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & krough3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for output file only B; directly after the merge copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the new file instead of merge (unlock) is checked, then examines & kimper3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging will execute a file after the other. you state column shows Fertig when the merge was successful, and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparision method is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder merge mode C is used as the target, in the two-folder merge B is selected as the target and when synchronizing becomes A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to skip over certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select Start folder start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to select only the current item, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If contradictory file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that points to the erroneous elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options to run, simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merging window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select another directory merge and continue or press F7. if you haven't saved it, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kDiff3 will continue its work with the next record.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When & kDiff3; click on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to resolve the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before you proceed to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you notice & kDiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them together again. even if the merge action was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kDiff3; (Set Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit to the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. there may be several patterns to be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig. * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig. * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a leading dot mark marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kDiff3; not on possible recursions will result in an endless loop and & kimper3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">(the number of unsolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders on a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the changelation date and the file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is deprecated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to familiar with the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equally large. this can be useful, for example, when copying the changelation date. please use caution. this option is deprecated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of assembling the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered insecure as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and will get the .orig. if an old backup file already exists with the .original extension, this will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge whole folder. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually the folder-merge-view remains visible during merge individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch the option directory & text window into the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You may also need to merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do this, use the File Now File merge from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you launch the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: read new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively und. or... this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masking. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date differs from the original. (note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference spectator in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in KDiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a KPart, it assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then, & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kDiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparisons of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now you are compelling) already exist. in addition, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL softwares for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have probably compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure installs configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this actually actually coincidence but this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost however, if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has so far been too large. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; released and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use many colors for highlighting differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">See http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the root folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kDiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems while compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report on the & kde; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences show: files identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to reread the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed which show differences. this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior will likely change in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed again when you click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop, change their size, change them or move them. this works both within a working area and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & pager; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu has only the two entries Pager. clicked on, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize, maximize, on desktop and finish. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">When this checkbox is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is shown together with name, the names are marked with ordal numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise, only the blank spaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically leaves & Kpager; in a 2xn grid, as from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal display shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row, which is very good for the display laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as icons or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and set-up then select switch... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently it cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have a write permission for the file, you need to login as user root or contact your system administrator. in this file, you need to register the key windowTransparentMode and assign it to this value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new features. it is optimized for use on high-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you & kmag; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnification window. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window.</seg>

<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button down, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are using the & Shift; click button or use the & MMB, you can postpone the selection window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse-cursor persists for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Syndrome) and which any mouse clicks are pains.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse-cursor holds a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and those of those mouse-click pain. besides, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain generated by clicking the mouse and assists so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also have pain caused by the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent debit activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay time must pass after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the intelligent shift is switched on, the shoot-down time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before the mouse button takes place again, if no moving of the mouse takes place in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking the mouse shift. if this function is enabled, it creates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this moves will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider Sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at every start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the knob button, the settings will be reset to the last push of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best way to use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you are accustomed to the automatic mouseclick, you will later be able to postpone the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware at which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral elements of windows or at locations in the browser window, which do not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse jacks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you need to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily be scratched with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using intelligent shifting in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation no longer can end the operation by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can even click a mouse click. here, the status of & kmousetool is reset, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor over where you want it. but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to have a keyboard input. thus, accidentally moving mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to use this way to copy and paste it into the clipboard or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent slide if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, mark text instead: drag at one end of the text area a mouse click and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this becomes everytime, if & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a click of the mouse. so you know exactly when when intelligent shifting begins the imposition time. later, you can use the intelligent shift even without the audible mouseclick. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; the XTest extension needs to be installed for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; hold the mouse button once the mouse-cursor is short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and who are pressing the pressing of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a drag-process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader while & ktts; just one reads it, this output will stop and terminate.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text jobs as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String Translators replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can either be supplied as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; it is provided with predefined string translators like: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Transformer use an XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. included in the delivery of & ktts; include some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With ballot selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card reader, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter states that its rules do not apply, it still gives the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or & kde; notification is sent to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not enabled and is not used. filter will be processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the below follow-up dialogs are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">To set up string filter filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name, it just has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text job speaks one of the languages registered here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click the & Ctrl; key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs get you with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; -Numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID Copy-3432 indicates, you may only enter Copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string translation filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filters if they match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison to words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited by delimiters (whitespace) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs or Edit as help to compile these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; Transform transforms & XML; using XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such changes. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is attainable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The speaker system allows you to send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card reader, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text passed to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker's properties, which gives the text to & ktts; the speaker is selected and the properties of the spokesman arranged on the card board.</seg>

<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the subscriber you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements. click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speaker optional filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filters if applicable. you must apply at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2688">With these slider, you set the volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some controls and display them gray, the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of the KTTL, so that (with larger memory usage) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card, you can set up special actions whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. once the issue of screen readers has been read, the retained contracts are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning stops the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; nevertheless greet someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, the audio output is inserted into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message is active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text entries. for messages, warnings, and screen readers, there are no special promotions, if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To start with & ktts; read KNotify messages, start kttsmgr and click alerts. the card notifications will appear.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains marks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. besides brands for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is a part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML is only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Configuration dialog are not set to 100, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-level detection filter (SDB filters). SBDs can start reading text into single sets. thus, you can also start or stop orders in a manner on the map card, not the entire text order. this allows you to skip or stop orders in a manner on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-box recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set of rules for set-up filters is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add other set-of-box recognition filters, but beginners will get discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setting up of the speaker selection by trying. switch off the speaker selection and select text for reading. check on the ticket selection again, change some features and check how the speaker's choice changes. of course, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop text jobs on the map card orders or cancel, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set-box recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for set-up and add a tablature symbol (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tablature characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set-in recognition filter maintains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages, or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the standard defined boundaries filter by default, you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card-card subscriber selections you can override the settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card reader). in other words, no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Using the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktts; these actors from. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker, the most likely the originally set-up properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the required subscriber properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the subscriber you want. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when publishing the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is shipped in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker area, which is best suited to the following, click on the standard speaker button and then use the speaker that is best suited to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it starts. I have compiled debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; was finished. probably you need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved, it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output about ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I get a text job, freeze & ktts; a. on the & konsole; appears a message that says: 'to open PCM'.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts with ALSA are occurring which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr won't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals to add the new voice. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL where you found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card card audio there is a setting speed. to do this, the program must be installed sox and can be found via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card card for speaking devices. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the talk speed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because HTML is converted to SSML.) Enable either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very bold, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML converter, and set up the talk speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't want websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival orator, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the day SABLE GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file for converting SSML into Saber the GENDER tags. the same holds true for the VOICE-tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can do it in & ktts; no longer proceeding or going back. on the mail bag orders will be shown, the order will consist of only one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) may not be filtered. instead, use a filter for the set-in recognition instead.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way, like other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter are displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in the & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured so that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and the setting of network properties possible.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices to install & Linux are installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempt to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the choice is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited for distribution and releading. by marking the non-recurring setting, the setting can be set permanently. the next start of the network settings will then be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, change is not possible. in the System Administration mode, you can enter the System Administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces tab is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network interfaces are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed in the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... setting up in the device dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced Settings display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, are selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection of Manuell, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & konsole, you can see if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. turn on a switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switch off the activated networked device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>

<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name into an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed, .DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and up or downgradation in the list with buttons additions or herders in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution can be added a DNS server. it will be displayed in the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... Do the Edit Display dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of named hosts describes the name-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for the Booten when there is no DNS server available. in small, closed networks it can replace the DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains a number of entries that are known to name, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported. this version of IP still under test should be replaced in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add the New alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the known machine has several aliases, de button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit... Edit the Dialogue machine will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately active in the system. in order to enable the changes, the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm), if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one & konsole; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde suffices; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section all configuration files are discussed by & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely disseminated. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point to assign a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the net mask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own host).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This part contains the configuration files affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if in the event of active DSL connections there is another content than fixed there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the ability to store multiple archives on a tape. the first thing was to create a surface for tar, which then presented the capability of dds2tar for quick, selective emptapping. the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be involved by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; back the tape and reads the tape's pre-tensioning information. recognizes & kdat; the tape don't spell the spell on the tape, you'll be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the pre-spell, searches for the matching index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the belt index is to be redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was inserted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the strap, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; is indicated by a change of the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; can be used it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting with & kdat;. if your tape drive requires to be formatted before you can be formatted. floppy disks are usually preceded by formatting of the tape, DAT drives on the other hand do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacitance, continue with formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically included and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you hit the backup procedure, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local filesystem tree with a tick. only the so-called files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">The dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Tick the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on any of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog appears to check. this dialog shows the progress of the checkout process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can start restoring, the files that are to be restored, have to be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the Settings dialog appears. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog appears to restore. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to recreate the belt indexed file on the basis of the tape file. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can re-create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder where the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the newly selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only those files are stored on the same file system as the folder. folders, which are on other filesystems, can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine what files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings above the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device node for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, sends & cdat; before the tape is inserted, the command mt load to the drive. with some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when releasing the integration of & kdat; the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option for floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; change the hardwardly block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, with which hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen shot, & ksystemlog; features available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemLog tries to open the system log; it will not display it, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you & ksystemlog; most likely do not run with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found in / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or according to entered strings. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically, so that only the protocol rows will be displayed next to the filter. in default, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter search term will only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of step errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than protocol lines of the stage hint. the colored representation of log lines can be turned off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identifier (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">"" "in addition, you can use the" "" "To new lines" "" "option in the main window pop-up menu to view all new entries in the log lines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the window menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You find more information about the sources of sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly develops to the standard for the control of the program start at boot-up of the system in the & Linux world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to change a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and re-formatting. this is why you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service you want to start when switching the system or switching to another runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial, which only once started. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for the program init at different places and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you will get it repaired by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it's an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the restart argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I might have a server runlevel that only runs httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of the available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will not happen when you pull out an entry from the range of availables.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. in order to merely copy it to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Edit from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired Runlevel (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. use the tab key to change between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before executing it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are extracted from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered from & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine will start constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary introductory programs of these distributions but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapters adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled limited space limitations (Quota) for users, a card card will be created, where you can make individual adjustments. other cards appear, if shadow passwords or / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The file card password management appears, if shadow -passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd, are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears, if for at least a built-in filesystem space restriction (quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, whereby the space limitations are contained in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the file system with space restriction</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs is found in the field Primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group Dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group or click the matching button of the toolbar. editing or deletion of the selected user or group will work analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO bootmanager, remove, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
