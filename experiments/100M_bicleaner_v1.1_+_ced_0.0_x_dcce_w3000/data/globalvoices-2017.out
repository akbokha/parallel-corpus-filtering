although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
as many of my generation grew up with American films , I d@@ anced American music , read American writers and run their sport .
indeed , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
at the age of 14 , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ por@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; mir Was &apos; s , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only intensi@@ fied my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to accept in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish letter of love about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ American and women publicly .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he gained in the republi@@ can pre @-@ elections was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party ever .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply belie@@ ver with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s view of view did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
m@@ umps int@@ oler@@ ance is also contra@@ sted with gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me as her son .
she still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life with much patience and grace .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as r@@ assi@@ sts .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in another way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
could it be that these vot@@ ers , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a. d . Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebels against all other ethnic groups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; p@@ un of white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones described it has killed exactly that which America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried lou@@ der and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now a sl@@ ump country , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the parag@@ ua@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and binding violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come with laugh@@ ing and gl@@ itter@@ ing eyes and play in the bu@@ stle and play the day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
over 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of As@@ unci@@ ón &apos;s largest gar@@ bage dump in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Recy@@ cl@@ er under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made of gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and that is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tonnes of waste every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - as people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that tac@@ kles the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it sought out the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were thus appropri@@ ated and inclined to welcome a law cr@@ us@@ her of this kind at its co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to tap one of their har@@ bours and refused to grant him a fishing licence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries , who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team who discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the region &apos;s waters : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network were the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and work together . they exchange information and stand out each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal F@@ ishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries circul@@ ated , the actions today are done in real time , with trac@@ eable on FISH i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , such susp@@ icious routes can be detected - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information , meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which loses the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , attrac@@ ting commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also the illegal fishermen .
their practices include , among other things , such as the s@@ ails under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying ph@@ antom patterns , fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You dar@@ ed not to run my harbour &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships .
it has discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tr@@ acked and found escape ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that aims to help FISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious vessels more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to detect the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at try@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , a NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be ordered by satell@@ ites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . it aims to help FISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
however , FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO sky@@ light , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ walker has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch in collaboration with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project running on which a global system allows tracking ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only sense crimin@@ als , but frigh@@ ten them .
ships that previously conf@@ is@@ cated without a license and hardly had to count with consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in FISH @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats have more licenses since then .
after helping Somalia to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board to@@ wing networks , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries joined forces , called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the aim of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report his first major triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without licence and were used to@@ wing networks that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also introduced into prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way of working towards the protection of the oceans actually works across the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is spreading further : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; taking back the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government rejected the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emp@@ tin@@ ess by gathering on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : die Rück@@ er@@ or@@ ber@@ ung Venezu@@ elas ) , images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against it can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country , among other things in the area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ northern federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which makes itself felt in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute short@@ age of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the office of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; but in the end the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % for annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the elec@@ toral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the National Assembly on 27 October , as well as a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , on 3 November , should continue to block the referendum on the removal of office .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil battle and on November 3 all to Car@@ acas to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the Action Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures from the mar@@ ches published in real time testify to an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter pictures , which tell of con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators attempted to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many national guards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the amount of supp@@ ression per day :
so the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for an office de@@ duction procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs with :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natur@@ es are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal of your ministry !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has not taken little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and has preferred to hide critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adap@@ table version of an interview given by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I believed that was all right .
I felt like a secret .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who said before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone named him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend about it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP .
watch out that they will not kid@@ n@@ ap you one day and I will have to save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
that is why he for@@ b@@ ade me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blank@@ et and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were cut off and stopped me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I approached and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was there .
they un@@ tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and put a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell instantly and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that one man can harm another so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose Luis L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked men were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , men cau@@ tioned quietly on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told home about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , was indic@@ ted by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ ings came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this road and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; battle @-@ spo@@ on@@ &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war @-@ men are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that are taken against an enemy that was fought .

but if you go into a house and ste@@ al the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then that is not a war mare but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who drove your cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you alone .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so was my father .
I have no single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a Roll@@ kr@@ agen@@ pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time the defense , a co @-@ conspir@@ ator accused me of being at this crime . I resist@@ ed , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you have been exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but what are the bodies to van@@ ish for ?
why do children kid@@ n@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why have their bodies disappeared ?
did these people not have families to whom one could hand over their remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and thrown somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought of displaying my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ g@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended are actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I received the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me that I am prejudi@@ ced . I have finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was accused of 416 Cri@@ mes : severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 very severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years of age .

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the mag@@ nitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended due to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the Court denied li@@ fel@@ ong pun@@ ish@@ ments and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were claims .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdi@@ ct : murder , torture and rape by Am@@ t@@ sp@@ ers@@ ons . # Es@@ War@@ Staat@@ ster@@ ror@@ ismus
all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military members , former police and civilian staff .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have been working for justice for the victims for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research was 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial which is now being led by human rights organizations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Ky@@ oto zu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Ky@@ oto , in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
arrangement of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , last month , witnesses to a very ab@@ sent translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means wron@@ g@@ ly - but perhaps also with vi@@ cious rear @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terri@@ fic mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1st to 20th September .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , which is appearing in Ky@@ oto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture was ap@@ ologi@@ zing for the translation error . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text they received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the in@@ adequate correction of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved nation@@ wide in accidents is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ ioren 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the above @-@ mentioned re@@ por@@ ter brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently are against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error received among other things the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation really not , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are multi@@ fac@@ eted .
for translation you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction is that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language that might translate translations into English . this may be due to missing understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can nevertheless produce translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese team , whose English skills are considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the s@@ worn and mysterious pro@@ positions that arise through machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harm@@ less , but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations .
in the future , the city of Ky@@ oto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ oring campaigns on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Surfen ) des IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet performances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
also other online channels bore photographs of the protests in Car@@ acas which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . back then , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national channels I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers errors or refuse the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third sealed channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ eram@@ an El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests live in Car@@ acas , was det@@ ained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police cust@@ ody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testimon@@ ies of other crimes , just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of structural .
the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , one calls for Paraguay the more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating from her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness testimon@@ ies , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ ced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated to the cri@@ cket is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family who has their daughter in the belief that they can finish their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assi@@ sts the girl with him and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ve .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed v@@ estig@@ es of violent blo@@ ws . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military unit Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a servant at the arrival office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ reira beat on a pole on Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela committed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they referred the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and the photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without paper@@ work , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a spe@@ edy examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pointing - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his job .
their brothers had to go all work and began to sell cand@@ y on the street or on the market to earn money .
they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
Friday , for example , she cle@@ ans@@ ed the fridge , so@@ iled the living room , polish the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get bor@@ dered food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the house@@ wife &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but didn &apos;t stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone listening to while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits again there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose again , declared them .
she was quite clear , however , that she had paid for everything she got from them with their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; a thing about which almost never was spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I did not have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belong to no group .

the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job ads for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administrators of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ anov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a little mate for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
beginning from Monday if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ ven girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the advertisement ob@@ sol@@ ete once again :
dear friends , I found one . I just look if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( cri@@ cket tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testimon@@ i@@ als of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paragu@@ ays , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ adores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í ) , and the Men@@ s@@ ú system ( where the workers are considered semi slaves ) , and the system of Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers act as semi slaves ) .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill of law prescri@@ bes Egypt &apos;s social media users to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently approved a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations on the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority in order to be able to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the law , a place would then be set up , which is entrusted to give citizens a permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register with their right names and ID numbers on the website of the site in order to be able to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill that consists of six parag@@ rap@@ hs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; any application that is running across the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video messages and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not give evidence on how Egyptian authorities should make the registration . un@@ clear is how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to control regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament delegation and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications minister to block Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level all around Facebook . due to it , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; senior research investig@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can control violent public and private spaces it could be done online as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to in@@ filtr@@ ate citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legisl@@ ature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed legislation against Cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality in which a life sentence served for those guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish natural guard protects the Persi@@ an le@@ op@@ ard in the war designated by the war

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization are working to protect the ghost of the Persi@@ an le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which touches Africa and Asia , belong to the Persi@@ an le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conserv@@ ation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persi@@ an Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a le@@ op@@ ard really in the wild game is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera all , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passi@@ on@@ ately likes to show another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies on wild living animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , the newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of the major pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal towns disappear from the map .
even to this , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was experiencing a nuclear accident , even on its own alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local perspective , which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the report also contains descriptions of the leading players including key financial met@@ rics and analysis of competitive pressures within the market .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( subsi@@ dy acc@@ usal acrylic , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the closing light .
at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from temporary shel@@ ters , evacu@@ ated from temporary shel@@ ters , Cau@@ cas@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) will be able to settle into final re@@ plac@@ ements .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 still 35,@@ 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters where Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent here .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have res@@ umed operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have largely affected the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as in the case of mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent here .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants find it more difficult to earn their li@@ veli@@ hood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacu@@ ated authorities . she asked them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their feeling changed against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction to the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
as it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper boo@@ sted its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the mighty earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness of the worst , disaster caused , nuclear accident that Japan has ever had to experience .
from 16@@ 0,000 evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displac@@ ed in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23,@@ 000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent resi@@ dences .
according to the 2017 stand there are still more than 40 000 inhabitants from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees are still older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when you meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recogni@@ zes that one more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone about language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike touched her aff@@ ection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had attacked him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors performed him this Saturday and have now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered cri@@ tically .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás knew that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active ministry until the conclusion of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stro@@ kes on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would be beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care station , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary blocks are hur@@ rying to it shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was killed by a police officer in a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer , who has beaten him in his face by a police officer .
police raid tro@@ l@@ ley
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not the only state in Brazil that last Friday came to violent police deplo@@ y@@ ments against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
polic@@ emen were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber fin and tear gas .
dep@@ uty , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SOL ) , asked the police to reno@@ un@@ ce violence against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped off road protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically informed about a broken glass window in order to depic@@ t their cover pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives absurd , di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ indu@@ str@@ alization For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as the Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar harv@@ esting on the spot .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some have changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands up at 4 : 00 every day , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long period of time because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 volume produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway station of the municipality looked at even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agri@@ cultural Policy &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the 2001 level ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of altogether 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene speaks about the closure of the factory , N@@ ene speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first meeting , the first letters began to come .
it was officially included documents that would be distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed , addressing the addres@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was held over and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the ref@@ utation of the factory in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important work generator has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to work places and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ ali learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .

first Nations youth use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they do it through hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 , in order to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe The North@@ Star together .
the workshop expl@@ ores the fact that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street section in western Canada , where nearly two dozen most indigenous women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences by glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always able to speak mut@@ ually in the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a strain in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody is interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
that is the day when you will consume our cry .
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that one day we will lift ourselves up
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
in this way , they can grow and also move forward to our youth
so they can do what they have determined by the Creator

plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan

in Japan you can see plastic dishes nearly every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they will be exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( Her@@ bal Supp@@ liers , &quot; Aesthe@@ tic models of the courts &quot; ) of every dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend is turned into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ oms , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new vinyl w@@ rist@@ bands decorated with plastic tab@@ s , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences becomes increasingly complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , IK@@ URA or Sal@@ mon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleas@@ antly .
our latest cell phone support has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also friction balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
further sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # her@@ ds@@ but@@ ary
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ ici@@ ons and fat@@ alities appear regularly only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on Dru@@ gs such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , sho@@ cked the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ p@@ se behind each bone in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) , which aims to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories about people who came into the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project in such a way :
organized crime can not only be feared for our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive whole municipalities a lot of kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear changes life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who choos@@ es secret tom@@ bs for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today to seek the task we have asked ourselves to seek and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is named Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid off because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are we to get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) when he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that they also have something to happen to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to persu@@ ade them to stay spar@@ ed from such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of ext@@ or@@ tion in the capital district : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als cr@@ ushed money from their business for month , until they had not only destroyed the business , but had torn apart their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never stops , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
we only contact us if absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are apart from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kid@@ n@@ apped or killed .
I asked myself in these terrible days , if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ tillas warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years ago when he was only a few blocks away from his home , who saw bloody suff@@ rage of his father who had been shot by armed men from a driving car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the struggle against it mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Council of Civil Security and Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 deaths per day .
this is just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories are still alive in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; animal pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand uns@@ af@@ e words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is presented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to up@@ lift a rum@@ or or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something is the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to convert trag@@ e@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank wagon crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of poth@@ oles , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tro@@ l@@ ley fell victim .
officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ op@@ ed including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people who looked at the football world champion@@ ships .
houses inc@@ iner@@ ated and char@@ red bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned for ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horri@@ fic scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was discovered several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and b@@ ushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been piec@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time was exempl@@ ary .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am &apos;s attempt to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as it was mistakenly presented as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
another step further brings personal comments as this example wron@@ g@@ ly fal@@ si@@ fies the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning announcement , released by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were blo@@ ws , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , it appeared as the following , which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein had said , monks and politicians had taken part in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information .
the original article , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being that statement , but did not have the picture taken in connection with the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information borders can cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine ink Eye has found 344 images below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) showing the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private parties , social media platforms and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried other attempts to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ usive use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which page they have been published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be found completely ( on the map in orange ) :

as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims killing the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar was admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image remains in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Cath@@ o@@ lics close to An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not origin@@ ate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria is burning the world ) .
the DR Congo &apos;s image , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in Paris and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ eted ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about Nig@@ eri@@ an massac@@ res , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a fal@@ si@@ fication .
from the Embassy in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated themselves .
there are other confirmed examples of an er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
ink Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and date / date stamps exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appear clearly after the original crash of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming is used to discuss how African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally contributed to drinking water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the real horror of what actually happened in the DRC , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a ref@@ usal is equ@@ ating to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ tiz@@ ing and the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media influence others ) .
while there is a lot of discussion about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture may be somewhat sug@@ ger , which can also be detached from the context or completely ab@@ usive way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ mount@@ able ) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ th@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes somewhat context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Study for your parents in recognition of how to care for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess you feel after you get war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Birds his own words from his blog about :
they de@@ mis@@ e other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite wine here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ds and floo@@ ds in this decade .
fired by the mon@@ soon , which is usually deployed at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ t@@ ant@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have stepped on the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 persons were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud passages .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 secure places of residence .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly returned .
health and hygiene practices pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et regularly deliver updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri L@@ ank@@ as fatal floo@@ ds exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the beaten water peg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da E@@ la .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are completed for transport of emergency supplies to the residents enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been willing to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food@@ stu@@ ffs and vital goods for flood victims -
we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to inform the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ thal@@ ein .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pic@@ me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; SOS button , &quot; which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood @-@ water and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents to security and aid aid .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .
the Muslims you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use authorized .D@@ am@@ als in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and dear friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust you my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children . she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last minute we call for par@@ oles for women &apos;s rights .
in the next we trans@@ act rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some consider the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied up from an American flag , others sc@@ ans slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ domin@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are being mus@@ cled .
to be mus@@ cled
I am not alone with that .
this is even happening to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you feel when you think of him ?
to be in love ?
to be torn between ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western conception religion was wi@@ ped away , just like the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ised Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear , and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dist@@ anced the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ al them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty fool domin@@ ates our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades , while the US could not even elect its first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave @-@ ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and in@@ correctly that Sik@@ h men and children often become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and attacks .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion things
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narrative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is sag@@ en@@ tically failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the Muslim population is African @-@ stri@@ cken American .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation migrants from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ er were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were inde@@ cent Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ turned Muslim and American ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t wear all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also not be a the@@ ological expert to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for extra checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of emin@@ ent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bic series with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already fl@@ a@@ wed image of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who under@@ goes the head of a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ug@@ ly forms att@@ aches to our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity that is so extensive , so versatile and multi@@ fac@@ eted that it cannot fit into a drawer .
the author was in 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten .
use approved .
I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girl@@ friend , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the surf see that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual with my daughter when I wie@@ w her to my arms and whis@@ per her Arabian verses to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat every one of them three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always a part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters eventually posed in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grand@@ mother mother@@ ly with her sisters , as they have gained a competition of the art of the flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi four decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by an Imperi@@ um , which a company founded with the name Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time to see that my Zu@@ id grand@@ father cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family whom he was not allowed to enter into his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first fl@@ ask of the story was rejected over a Muslim country from a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ an sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ claimed history .
it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be American Muslims means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy tells the US and the susp@@ ect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a fre@@ ed black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this land .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple str@@ apping , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion provides more possibilities than a cube of magic , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in Muslim regi@@ str@@ ations , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes up a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims into their sights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars we lead and the bombs that we shed on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically un@@ correct picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to deny the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are campaig@@ ning for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous exempl@@ ary expressions that we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing that we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for conspir@@ acy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not existed ; now they domin@@ ate vast areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but that made me an un@@ disp@@ uted Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread baking lane in my speech .
things that may provo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may l@@ ur@@ p where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , conversations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than one hundred acade@@ mics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the work of the &quot; other &quot; have been revealed in public performance , was scientific at Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; just as my girl@@ friend and I do in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no President , the chocolate cake , while he already broken lands and &quot; to other made &quot; people bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urb@@ ane language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ett@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language from big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure places where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers create their history in their own language first and translate or then explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their representation make the audience aware of it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ad takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the tale of Has@@ en and the P@@ avian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his flag , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls for the US re @-@ launch of state debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , on 3 April 2017 , various religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march launched in the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ can Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen front for the audit of debts ) and the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishment of the debt also submitted petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand financial audi@@ ting and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding to the benefit of the economy .
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with decl@@ ining pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the state @-@ owned territory of the US - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
measures imposed on the outside will be risk without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration called the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night of light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , is dedicated to the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published last year and is available here is a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it is said :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the true costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ ages and to make some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprison@@ ed in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book entitled collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that p@@ ushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the cust@@ ody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , its place of stay and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the conductor of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes was more than the work he started with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles mer@@ ging with local traditions and Persi@@ an influences .
Bass@@ el did not know at that time , that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sys@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be of in@@ valuable value to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
typically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent all my life with it , dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el gave me English even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English good .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has wonder@@ ed . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners on how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a sample cloth she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in cust@@ ody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available in roy@@ alty @-@ free .
envel@@ ope of Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink into the world of your charming eyes ,
that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace us ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the prison of prison
and I will jump into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :

I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bash@@ ar &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption sentenced to prison sentence again on previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ans responded with anger to a corruption incident where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence , on which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants due to pollution of 54 million Me@@ als ( approximately 800 000 euros ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public money from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was given Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to refer to his old posts as the company did not perform discipline proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants don &apos;t mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our judicial system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the imp@@ acting person .
the company apparently was silent and made no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also decl@@ ines this behavior and considers the case as &quot; ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would have been advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of which left half .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to harm .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be happy to pay for his silence .
di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already been so massi@@ vely off@@ ended .
Cam@@ b@@ aza want to return mor@@ ality and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it only served itself by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza uses the state as a hand@@ piece to an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who has been rel@@ o@@ aded and ultimately sentenced to a long term of imprisonment .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain in memory for ever as the first independent president , but also as sharp , incis@@ i@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of everything , also to sell the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he does not change tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dismis@@ sive :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and was released .
and today the company , in which he will make money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ τ@@ ι@@ к Й@@ ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the r@@ acial word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users in@@ justice &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ ushes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or cau@@ tious socialism ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in trying to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically generate hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use , have been cens@@ ored .
moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ itt@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ca@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , whether they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question face ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook Initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical before dis@@ semin@@ ating all posts that are suspected of dis@@ semin@@ ating rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ tor@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all those who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy doesn &apos;t last long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to keep track , posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the Post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have begun without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the frau@@ dul@@ ent posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales , that would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots of Facebook posts , which did not contain hate speech , but were nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to check out if Facebook remo@@ ves the mail containing the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mail says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks seeks to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ation of hate speech on his bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that will prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age of mar@@ rying is now 18 .
in May 2016 , Bro@@ ther Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter @-@ Relig@@ ious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interv@@ ene since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married with 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed to aboli@@ sh laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s to@@ e , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition ensured tension in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there was no doubt whether the opposition would ever agree with the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who could be discussed , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law pro@@ claim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle re@@ posted to Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
after having previously been approved in the Senate , the draft can now become law .
the majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the ministry of education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk which has conce@@ aled the heart of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson felt that it took long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ey Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marri@@ age@@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the change of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives , and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who have reb@@ elled have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ ho@@ jal@@ ab@@ use .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations . congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months before Mahar@@ aj announces his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to break his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the general prosec@@ utor Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ ponent of the law , said that it was quite lawful for Mahar@@ aj to act against the law , most of the social media users would wish to tackle the issue differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion so general , in a way that can only provo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of speaking of the problem that the state , our daughters from it , would be mis@@ used , that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ headed men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use dressing tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report from the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 has been held since the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror pages ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform depos@@ ited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator links ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
in spite of legal prohibition , the content is irre@@ vo@@ cable .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything in place snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed fashion .
this can help users to watch at least all Wikipedia information , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only scre@@ enshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that anyone can use to host similar Mir@@ ror@@ pages when it is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni told Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy ad@@ ress , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server re@@ dire@@ cts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
a su@@ bo@@ li@@ ant r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned moti@@ fs and washed out colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera on himself and to try to recti@@ fy the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage .
and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aja ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
instantly I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to shoot pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood before the Tig@@ ers face to face to face :
a tiger cannot be bo@@ ther@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late at night . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush seemed to appear . he immediately sets off , we see ourselves and he gaz@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to make recordings of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arri@@ vals .
see below some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India women are avoiding the utmost care to pronoun@@ ce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to the social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should ab@@ ject the norm to sustain this practice in life .
last year , mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was condemned by a false tri@@ bunal and rejected by her family and the village community after having contacted a married family by name .
the tradition of their wives also not to mention the name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , played a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them only where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage and to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club .
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion was of women who did not call their hus@@ bands by their names .
she chose this topic because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ eld and have never ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini comments :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not conc@@ eive this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round about it .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent until the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women attempted to engage the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the cr@@ ushing of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was just standing before him ; another decided to release all the accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ bing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on their behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the following days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law was star@@ ing her she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why must women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the car@@ cin@@ ogenic point if he did it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion during each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things they had never imagined before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincer@@ ely about some things , for example as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they are .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes .
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
most of them are okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ war @-@ Kur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a pants ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice , mor@@ ality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly getting into the re@@ els :
we have made only small steps so far .
some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then they stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including myself , make it still , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two women continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ ead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as h@@ ag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to only 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag walked along the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , observed 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had achieved their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail trade Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . thirty years ago they were here in Tokyo .
songs from the Beat@@ les are still sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll will be John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :

exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year .
and of course , some companies use the fan base also market @-@ related , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .

flat @-@ headed men are drag@@ ged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s aim of attacks .

a new system of ab@@ duction of flat @-@ headed people for the organ traff@@ icking , probably for religious purposes , troubled the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
it gives local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia told the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on flat @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission carried out in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be W@@ ey@@ a lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Muslim police were following the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange district , where the assass@@ inations took place .
Hus@@ eig@@ ne Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police already mentioned the case :
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of bald individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district of Mor@@ avia , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for pres@@ um@@ ably ab@@ err@@ ing ritu@@ als , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ antha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE would like to adopt A MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT SI@@ CH ashamed a country where people would have shame to seek sex against good notes , and who would not hurt others or even take their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; would be hun@@ ted .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ inations of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) has a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ tille @-@ wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by people who pret@@ ended to be an insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that their man was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bash@@ ar &apos;s stay and constitution was unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials informed that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are hon@@ our@@ ing the creativity of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web @-@ movement .
and we acknowledge the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the past five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death in cust@@ ody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen &apos;s Seri@@ ous Thre@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the imprison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his attor@@ ney announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) , having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China referred to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to open calls of the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him to be treated abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway two years ago
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was sho@@ cked when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government reported that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union ( EN )
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they wish and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as it helped him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person from the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the news agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the emb@@ assy promp@@ ts the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere with Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to impose the Chinese government on releasing Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns about whether the whir@@ l around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada to Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide an adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to care about his family .
Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u Mrs. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk and contact someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old the rights granted to the exercise of these rights .
France , Belgium , France
France &apos;s foreign ministry requested China to release Li@@ u on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family are to have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France will ultimately receive it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan required China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ makers Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progres@@ sive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectu@@ als to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama - Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u on 28 June and stated that many have asked him to pray for us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore . Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the International branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one ques@@ tioned whether New York was a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal &apos; countries , in view of it , it appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re comes up from author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism that pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses to his American guests in the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ Ans@@ wers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
he tar@@ red corresponding questions with Non @-@ Ans@@ wers of rational Art .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our valued K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble clearing this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the whole host of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the co@@ dex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ ev@@ enly important even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam who , as a leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ian statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard that I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that properly and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integr@@ ates the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ham &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goo@@ gl@@ ed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a joy@@ ful advoc@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country are the sovereign rights of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore make their military service , they only defend their city , but not their country ?
who must our prime minister pay invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink HR ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to be affir@@ med , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices , recently , asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series that reveals rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et will be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his dialogue partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook internally in rage if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us from American Canadi@@ ans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans will get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small A@@ hor@@ n@@ sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country on ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I admire very much .
there wouldn &apos;t be anything for me if you would be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the punch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nett &quot; is basically to be ridi@@ cul@@ ous - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harm@@ less is to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that pass around one .
I would go even so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a leading part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; might just be cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I meanwhile connect with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop @-@ band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ odi@@ des the Jun@@ ta , who took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continue to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) describes a young man who tells him what rules he makes his girl@@ friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not expressly politically , the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 list@@ ings .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of the Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ kon@@ ian section 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution which gives absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings Change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people , who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also established , the online contents monitored and persons accused of having abandoned the monarchy , prosec@@ uted and prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand is committed against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems that the j@@ unta still pursu@@ es is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax ev@@ asion .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now more than 20 years have passed since Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ud@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ cken of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ asi@@ es , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today live for the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16,@@ 000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 43,@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ u@@ kov@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that all served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded royal buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Khr@@ ush@@ che@@ v &apos;s , which still house one or two families , one recogni@@ zes on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother banned us that we let ourselves be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ YA , as mentioned in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave her in front of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will always stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aunt G@@ AL@@ YA says that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; called T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ YA to her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ational partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and ch@@ ick@@ ens .
it tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the dec@@ ayed buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood who care for in@@ genu@@ ity in their lives .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy A@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican girl , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink gro@@ oved frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.50 a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez says , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; mo@@ m Africa !
where are you M@@ um Afrika ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys medicines that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him whether M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ ghurt mou@@ st@@ ache ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy A@@ acken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her since African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil already , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans speak already at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy we@@ aker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards in order to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will get in touch with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez says that her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has started helping them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered .
at the moment there are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other people also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled from people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single woman , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go next steps .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses , travelers can consult their teleph@@ ones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she blo@@ ws in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair lich@@ ens , who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad while she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices made in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Tian@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it tells the district government to install a monitoring app called Jing@@ wang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive Radio Free Asia report , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police said that the app would identify and follow the terrorists &apos; distribution channels , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ wang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking porno@@ graphic sites , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remote control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors is to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine @-@ based internet shut@@ down@@ s .
the media outlet , based on Twitter , released the cens@@ ored news in China ) , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers subsequently checked the residents as they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official Jing@@ wang app .
a mobile noti@@ fications required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of bond@@ age by the contracting technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( Haz@@ ardous Resorts COUN@@ TY COUN@@ TS ) also released a j@@ ing@@ wang product description , from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of Jing@@ wang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in Jing@@ wang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated organisations , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action however hurt the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that makes every honour to their name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one who has broken down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the ac@@ tress , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence even when the Earth continues on the axis of disaster . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that have built your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security servant formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ out the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all districts cov@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t make any high demands on a city that is stu@@ ff@@ ed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood ceased to function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I interrupted the silence by crying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to work together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations and completely fulfilled .
in such a moment you are aware that you fre@@ t the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t care about you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your vote after you have sent it all the way to the office of the Security Service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was at my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure in my case when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father straight away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed proposition is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I pre@@ ach all details exactly before I enter the room .
different from what else they have assigned me a bigger cell this time .
I have to share them with only one other prisoner and let me sit right away without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I moved back to an old way of communication : to beat against the wall with the f@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be recognized by me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my voice ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers are linked to his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be heard immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws , which are on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear her scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es come out every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ onal black@@ list and betra@@ yed the narrow eye view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
I take care of the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation and meeting in Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man , at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that gli@@ de him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more wei@@ ght@@ ti@@ ger@@ es with your life than to open up this day @-@ edit and prot@@ esting at demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing done to earn this sentence .
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hang@@ man rejo@@ ices in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my cri@@ es were not satisfied with him yet , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a gar@@ bage collector , or whether it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t find any favor about it , which is why he res@@ or@@ ted to an electri@@ cally charged rod .
power flo@@ wed my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my semi @-@ naked body that stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
several hours passed , which showed me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with dir , Ass@@ fu@@ ck &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always fre@@ ed me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he locks himself to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ spot@@ ted lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had to flee from their village to Palestine where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned off their tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that extend from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stres@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured into water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the d@@ war@@ ms of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ ist of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose are in the first place of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , one simply avo@@ ids having basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - in order not to land in jail .
recently , Jord@@ ani@@ ens &apos;s Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old @-@ time legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement might not be simply rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually reflect an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reck@@ oned to be traditional sex men , giving his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently clou@@ ded unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
in the past few years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ or@@ ary mor@@ als &apos; - the in@@ official outside left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary kill@@ ings in 2016 reached its climax ; however , it is still more difficult to support the institutional infrastructure to support women who have become victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of inner @-@ family violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are held in@@ definitely in jail , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures , as well as the guarantee of the family that nothing will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for not shy away from themes that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , that he does not separate his music , which is full of explicit ab@@ uses on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I became a politi@@ cian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself quite often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; get what you want , &quot; whether faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme Ro@@ ya , to see later that his comments were ri@@ pped out of the context , distor@@ ted and in his opinion cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als is not dish@@ on@@ est Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ was , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the Board of Directors , with the reason they had vo@@ iced critical questions in social media about the problems that were deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has now fought with M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner@@ most changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ tions and artificial kind of democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that .
as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to coat more arms and therefore also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the for@@ tresses , drums and dancing have been passed over more than one thousand years ago , in which armies mar@@ ched from the West of Japan to the Nor@@ theast to force the Indi@@ genous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to their knees .
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to take a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only truth - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

often outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian people away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation like the one of the Fris@@ eurs .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where Street rau@@ b and illegal drug traff@@ icking are common@@ place .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
at the same time , Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts meet each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to receive training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities to offer , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel ej@@ ected ?
precisely this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) , which encouraged young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the FAR@@ C gu@@ err@@ illa movement ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the treaty of peace was so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
there is still a long way before Kolum@@ bi@@ ans , until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic around the clock and now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now res@@ ume their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian people had to join together and would have to help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , which should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary .
he tar@@ ried so he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed most urg@@ ently .
thus the plan came to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FAR@@ C , who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally .
the FAR@@ C members set themselves up as they did before in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of encour@@ agement from people from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly there ran the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embrac@@ ed him completely and sat next to the gr@@ en@@ ades .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was p@@ ity to be all the years of loyal companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else of life than war . to join FAR@@ C was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there who wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
to the start , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war @-@ controlled and the FAR@@ C acted in secret .
therefore , the FAR@@ C leaders explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social in@@ justice worked on the part of the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this mag@@ nitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
hearing those people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings , who were turned up@@ side by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian@@ ians were proph@@ esi@@ ed that after dis@@ arm@@ ament , peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , raise and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we at FAR@@ C now focus on peace , a policy without weapons .
that is why we call on all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life from Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and its first publication took place on the website of OC Media .
hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which hang@@ s like a sword of vap@@ our over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community , has not only emerged over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports published that address the deport@@ ation , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities arrested by susp@@ icious que@@ er men and stuck them into secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ lady , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after experiencing a group of Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen from the sexual orientation of their Land@@ s@@ woman , the hunt at Sab@@ rina was opened .
her life moved out of fear for her life in the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made the lap through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honour the family , you make a spot ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had caught everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two cat@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses were you placed - in the men or women of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
for this I am very thank@@ ful for him .
when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February , I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some perfectly unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie .
they put absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by passing through the streets ; others wanted me to live in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I hadn &apos;t changed my sex that everything was just a bad exc@@ use , and Photos@@ hop .
I have body @-@ size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rot@@ ten .
my human rights activists checked out the number plates - it turned out that I was tr@@ acked .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without regi@@ stering , without proof , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in safety , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you &apos;re stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really put effort to look like the person that she reminds of her past - so on my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who are d@@ ort@@ ef@@ old ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &apos; honor &apos; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are still gay men captured in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to turn to Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there to present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , but di@@ pped in a pur@@ pos@@ eful way to radi@@ c@@ alise himself .
OC Media : is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprison@@ ed for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after growing be@@ ards .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken with them .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports about it yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ ductions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think I was already familiar with Gros@@ ny before 2003 , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but eventually dropped us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short T@@ ops .
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never even curved my hair .
in front of the Russian Theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; so@@ ot is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yeah .
they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace hold ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about mor@@ ality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could sense how people started to change in the city .
those who were laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I returned home I could feel how the situation in the Republic deteri@@ or@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activities are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I join them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I have discovered these people themselves when I cl@@ ap refuge .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who wish to proph@@ esy with foam before the mouth , that there are no bo@@ ils among them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think about transi@@ gency to men who love men , and they believe that you change his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be accurate , different lifestyle settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desperate situation of the Arab ancest@@ or of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to raise the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after fir@@ ing himself .
some people quickly managed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab ancest@@ ral Min@@ ority , and campaig@@ ners on the spot warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to feed their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large majority of the Arab ancest@@ ral communities live in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their li@@ veli@@ hood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most abundant and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime depri@@ ves the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persi@@ an territories , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by d@@ rought , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i who are looking for a job , the primary school completed , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persi@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab ancest@@ or will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living from their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancest@@ or and to be hired as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , human rights activists hit alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter @-@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be femin@@ ist * in general .
for example , that despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I get to speak on skin color , on black women , on black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention what kind of body , psychological and verb@@ ally ab@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decided to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they are all agreed that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to institution@@ alised forms of r@@ acial motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are facing a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women to have the same rights every time , all men and all men . on the other hand , I can not consider myself as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in her thinking , which relate both to the sex and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a bl@@ ending and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender , because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to re@@ vere them for a better .
although inter @-@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to connect me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than being persistent for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we re@@ claim ourselves ) , we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has neither passed , nor ignor@@ es , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past seven years - mostly with surf@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary film by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution upon his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video was fil@@ med and edited for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film and multimedia journalist , based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , poor@@ ly observed sub @-@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help , oppressed communities , can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The we@@ eping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts , but more cannot be done .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mal@@ treatment , the acute indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful .
a few days later , the second woman moved back her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women permit an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who are ill @-@ traff@@ icking . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported at all in the law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ ts@@ 1 saw and statisti@@ c@@ 2 In@@ visible ill @-@ treatment and a legal system that is nothing inferior to Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , defective realisation of blo@@ ws and statistics
it is hard to see how many women are really ill @-@ treated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 women were indic@@ ted for domestic violence at the District Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 adverti@@ sements because of domestic violence in peace courts . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads arrived .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were ab@@ used physically , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minist@@ erial Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental ill @-@ treatment , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to every woman who ref@@ uses for bodily mal@@ treatment , two women who do not do this come to the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since there is no criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the prosecution authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
only until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman is due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not inter@@ fere
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then there was still . this should rep@@ ent her forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she en@@ du@@ red the psychological force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recogni@@ zable :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I read earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he would ever raise his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , which does not origin@@ ate from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic ab@@ uses .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ orian ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against its former partner who developed into an in@@ transparent legal battle between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not being applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ One ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original bill of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to a self @-@ employed criminal record and pun@@ ish tough@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the legisl@@ ature has been changed in some respects , in order to also gain the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , which feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tion , which is currently banned in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detention &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill had en@@ vis@@ aged most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process of procedure , which must bear the victims of violence at present , if they simply permit issu@@ ing and obtaining a safe housing to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is silent in the face of these facts is guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must allow for such a long display until mal@@ treatment is no longer regarded as normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconc@@ ile .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ ing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after b@@ anning a newspaper continues to attack targets
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been blocked because of a decision by the Ministry of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available on the homepage of the banned Newsp@@ aper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he will serve a one @-@ year prison term .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later returned to court .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after losing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , through a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of the security forces , particularly of the intelligence of inland intelligence , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , to restrict and to torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically perpet@@ u@@ ate peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces seized I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , after appearing in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ level parties holding hands of justice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials have been accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties tie hands to justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial board , was charged with the special department of the ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS accepted the assistant editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ ier@@ i &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the information minister had the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper in any way , including online , banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the M@@ ask@@ at Court .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the s@@ lander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3,000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 re@@ als ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to the public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 US ri@@ al ( 13,@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after its 6 @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he will serve his one @-@ year prison term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper is still exposed to attacks by the government of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 January , the Information Minister issued an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed another order , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the minister once again asked for the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include the closure of the website of independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the comprehensive violation of the press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work , and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : firstly , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines missing in the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment to research these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be recei@@ vers instead of being cre@@ ators themselves .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come back here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : what is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific education starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines only make articles accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them further on breeding .
the patents argue not only for single varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ on varieties . because of this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food safety are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition Mort@@ on still bre@@ eds a salad , but it takes longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a bou@@ lder is lying around which I have to d@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far to sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they with@@ stand trial , no one can breed a new type of sal@@ ads because all features are already patented . &quot; so he is doing as good as possible and tries to breed the tra@@ its he wants .
however , it is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative für &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders .
within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they were bred .
however , this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it so as to breed their own varieties , and not immediately to find it - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects for the future
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg have control over the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in greater contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural res@@ ili@@ ence .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stres@@ ses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not concerned with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; he says , and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as it is offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available freely . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is inc@@ ess@@ antly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it either not or only difficult for plant bre@@ eders .
for other plants there are still not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that massive cultivated plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than sal@@ ads or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of the point of view
plants are cultivated so that they have targeted properties - from those through which their taste or color improves all the way they thri@@ ve in certain environments and to with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decl@@ ining more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predict@@ able .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto disc@@ erns that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four genital fluctu@@ ations and the cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is responsible for the conservation of genetic diversity .
it contradi@@ cts the view , however , that intellectual property preser@@ ves other bre@@ eders as patents and the protection of plant varieties encourage innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such protection does not hin@@ der innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees that differently : 20 years to wait until a patent can det@@ ach , certainly not encourage innovation .
and if one has to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle has already been lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward and it will make us impossible if we will not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall Mort@@ on interfer@@ ed with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders we finally have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eders in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are used mass @-@ based her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , bre@@ eds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , it creates the most small seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding @-@ garden .

Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders through the avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ ents would be innovative : &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I need constantly new material for my catalog , as I know my competitors are selling my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which I think it &apos;s pretty easy . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , works together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Organization Agre@@ col works on an open @-@ source licence which ultimately forms a more formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding vary from country to country , why the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot be easily adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , stated that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ vos organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed tra@@ ys in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the Hi@@ vos &apos; programme for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems for which the official starting signal should be planned next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ vos , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration ) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - publish@@ es a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report .
the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is still more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains bt@@ - despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirm that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to yield .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first licensed site of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page of M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar &apos;s Al J@@ aze@@ era network due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web pages for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to Egypt in the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights scientist Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes non @-@ accessible websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , who is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting the student protests and taking up a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blog is probably not significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a si@@ ege ; an arrest , a temp@@ ted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an impact , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( A@@ fte ) Egyptian authorities shut down websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Eti@@ let@@ at .
A@@ isons also documented the blocking of providers , by switching Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
A@@ isons talked about their research :
on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ PN@@ s started .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and fil@@ tering content that Egyptian users may have access .
the situation is wor@@ sen@@ ed in addition to the fact that the cens@@ al decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day by day newspapers in all Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard moti@@ fs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer will assass@@ inate in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smo@@ kes Ph@@ armacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violent wave reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
so the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August , &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision declared the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper says that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions to cover .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; mean more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in view of a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible persons in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , enligh@@ tenment and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to statistics from 2015 in Brazil , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the kill@@ ings per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media enterprise in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia empha@@ sizes , has been repe@@ ating the state security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police blo@@ gger and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for a few years , however , after several reports on Sch@@ ik@@ anen and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , the U@@ PP was increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux comments from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the Rio authorities do not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a drag list is an un@@ shar@@ per point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; crazy balls . &quot;
war on or around , fact is that the people of the fav@@ elas in Rio will continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police cl@@ ause the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicop@@ ter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to vict@@ ories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are currently in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by Assad &apos;s regime .
since 2013 , these territories controlled by rebels have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , causing inhabitants to be locally produced or controlled by tun@@ nels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian assist@@ ants and acade@@ mics instruc@@ ted the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive dietary source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that had been struggling to announce this project for three years and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more &quot; to gain awareness . &quot;
to raise money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of plant@@ ing fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise funds on c@@ ando by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds origin@@ ating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was possible , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating food resi@@ du@@ es ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege are seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many regional capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were gr@@ ass@@ ed in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government called for a national mour@@ ning for the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of Gal@@ icia in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire qu@@ arri@@ es spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which over@@ sees forest areas by satellite images , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a suffici@@ ente ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users shared pictures :
this is Br@@ aga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Br@@ aga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread over the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predict@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federal Association of farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did so nowhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would have been able to happen again as in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits are ques@@ tioned in places with high fire risk .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought up after severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was requested by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity to fall , if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val carries on in the same article from the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of easily fl@@ amm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to the fires of this species .
to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt for its own civil protection data and inform@@ s the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the server didn &apos;t with@@ stand the storm of the 400@@ ,000 users who were tracking the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the fall of 1994 the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan was a land of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would no longer see her son any more - maybe even never again .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly vulnerable .
the Taliban known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ per found himself in Pakistan again .
he worked in a coal mine for a couple of years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his li@@ veli@@ hood .
back then as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t free@@ zing at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ eh was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed food to help in need twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high demand quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions stipul@@ ating asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us .
the civil rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they formally filed an application for asylum - which can still go for months after registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .

but his rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant li@@ fest@@ y@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af stuck its entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans have been operating , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industry and retailers and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ per with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; in this way , they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end .
A@@ shar@@ eh has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ ū Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in cust@@ ody for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy &apos;s Ne@@ ver Report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , vict@@ ories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority .
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months following a successful decision on the website of the authority , stat@@ ing their full name and identification number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the tri@@ g@@ gering of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; May a further member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal to introduce tough@@ er sanctions for the ins@@ ults of the president or a high official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the legislative proposal , such action would , however , be punished with prison and money pen@@ alties , such as legal experts at Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who had demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan , as more than 700 protest participants , had been arrested for four years in cust@@ ody for four years in cust@@ ody .
recently , his hearing was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison administration failed , according to human rights groups , to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is facing the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree on the charges of arms , illegal assembly , murder and murder .
in another case , a criminal court in Giza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ si@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activ@@ ist inter@@ ce@@ ases to transmitted documents
in May Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly backed a controversial bill , which would ensure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused officers am@@ ne@@ sty , if they return all un@@ lawful mon@@ ies .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at sheds light on how the pres@@ si@@ al plans for supporting the legislation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the nom@@ ination of his sources , indicating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Code , which journalists were entitled to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tun@@ is on May 9th as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their identity ?
according to the new rules of the Information Office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media .
it is also stated in the regulations that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that by elimin@@ ating anony@@ mer comments in sub@@ stitu@@ tions within social networks , it is un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have suggested in social media to sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations in order to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat , in the state government , failed to register as the &quot; organizer of the information propag@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government organiz@@ es a list of online services that organise the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court decre@@ ed the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , declar@@ ations that Turkey endor@@ sed the ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave to that the site was closed because it became &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ated with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , besides , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop snor@@ ing
following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance capabilities that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
