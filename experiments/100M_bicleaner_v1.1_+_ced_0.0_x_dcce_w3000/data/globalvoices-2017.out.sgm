<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I also grew up with American films, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "mir Was' s, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to accept in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish letter of love about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-American and women publicly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he gained in the republican pre-elections was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believer with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumpet's view of view did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Mumps intolerance is also contrasted with generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me as her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life with much patience and grace.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(a. d. Ü): as much as" "" "rebels against all other ethnic groups" "" "; pun of white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, as the great Van Jones described it has killed exactly that which America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried louder and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is this not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now a slump country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and binding violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come with laughing and glittering eyes and play in the bustle and play the day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">Over 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of Asunción's largest garbage dump in Paraguays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpet, trombones and percussion, all made of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tonnes of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that tackles the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it sought out the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus appropriated and inclined to welcome a law crusher of this kind at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to tap one of their harbours and refused to grant him a fishing licence.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries, who simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the region's waters: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network were the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equal and work together. they exchange information and stand out each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries circulated, the actions today are done in real time, with traceable on FISH i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pursues the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious routes can be detected - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information, meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which loses the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, attracting commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also the illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, such as the sails under false flag, fake license papers, specifying phantom patterns, fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an unbroken organized control system" "", "says Long." "" "a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You dared not to run my harbour" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escape ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious vessels more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to detect the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">However, FISH-i's team of African nations can indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO skylight, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, Skywalker has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch in collaboration with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project running on which a global system allows tracking ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only sense criminals, but frighten them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously confiscated without a license and hardly had to count with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats have more licenses since then.</seg>
<seg id="145">After helping Somalia to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015 six countries joined forces, called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH." "" "security is the aim of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report his first major triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without licence and were used towing networks that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also introduced into prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way of working towards the protection of the oceans actually works across the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% for annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine is, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptable version of an interview given by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said in the context of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had experienced as a boy and who said before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are multifaceted.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translation you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction is that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language that might translate translations into English. this may be due to missing understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can nevertheless produce translations in-house. then the Japanese team, whose English skills are considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sworn and mysterious propositions that arise through machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless, but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "navegar con Libertad" (Freies Surfen) des IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the internet performances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Also other online channels bore photographs of the protests in Caracas which were organized by oppositional groups who oppose the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was capped and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like vivoplay are popular with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. back then, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national channels I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a website is blocked by the DNS, the server answers errors or refuse the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third sealed channel, the transfer was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests live in Caracas, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelan access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="417">"" "the article is part of a series entitled" "" "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que caen" "", "edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one calls for Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes her underage son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for innumerable days of housework which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating from her studies, Alvarenga worked for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered witness testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is vaccinated to the cricket is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on double delusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family who has their daughter in the belief that they can finish their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assists the girl with him and justifies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starve.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín arrived in Caaguazú, her body showed vestiges of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military unit Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a servant at the arrival office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometres east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira beat on a pole on Marín until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela committed the practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl in the paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they referred the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and the photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without paperwork, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a speedy examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case occurs in court, the case of Carolina Marín could be pointing - if for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and began to sell candy on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They went all further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the northeast of Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a violent earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Miyagi prefecture. the prefecture of Miyagi was one of the major prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefecture of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had let whole coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even to this, Fukushima prefecture was experiencing a nuclear accident, even on its own alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local perspective, which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The report also contains descriptions of the leading players including key financial metrics and analysis of competitive pressures within the market.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare-houses (subsidy accusal acrylic, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the closing light.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from temporary shelters, evacuated from temporary shelters, Caucasu juutaku) will be able to settle into final replacements.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 35,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters where Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster in temporary shelters were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have largely affected the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima lie in the" "" "nuclear barrier zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as in the case of misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants find it more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuated authorities. she asked them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their feeling changed against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper boosted its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the mighty earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disaster caused, nuclear accident that Japan has ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160,000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent residences.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand there are still more than 40 000 inhabitants from Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees are still older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Unindustralization Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The municipality Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as the Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no appreciable sugar harvesting on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some have changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stands up at 4: 00 every day, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long period of time because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 volume produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the municipality looked at even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural Policy" by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the 2001 level (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of altogether 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene speaks about the closure of the factory, Nene speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeats the most," "" "scam." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first meeting, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially included documents that would be distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed, addressing the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was held over and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the land had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the refutation of the factory in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with themes that are important to them. they do it through hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014, in order to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-Gruppe The NorthStar together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop explores the fact that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a street section in western Canada, where nearly two dozen most indigenous women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always able to speak mutually in the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a strain in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookside of N'we Jinan the Strophe is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will consume our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that one day we will lift ourselves up</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">In this way, they can grow and also move forward to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have determined by the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes nearly every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they will be exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance Shokuhin sanpuru (Herbal Suppliers, "Aesthetic models of the courts") of every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend is turned into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matoms, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new vinyl wristbands decorated with plastic tabs, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences becomes increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, IKURA or Salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone support has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also friction balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further scurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # herdsbutary</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the suspicions and fatalities appear regularly only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on Drugs such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, shocked the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse behind each bone in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), which aims to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories about people who came into the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime can not only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive whole municipalities a lot of kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(german:" "" "how fear changes life" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who chooses secret tombs for his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew on a single day.</seg>

<seg id="772">"" "where are we to get them?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that they also have something to happen to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the hopelessness of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified that they were" "" "resident." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to persuade them to stay spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of extortion in the capital district: how a family with threats has been plundered." it describes how armed criminals crushed money from their business for month, until they had not only destroyed the business, but had torn apart their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never stops, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are apart from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or killed.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, if weeping would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years ago when he was only a few blocks away from his home, who saw bloody suffrage of his father who had been shot by armed men from a driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the struggle against it mixed with the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Council of Civil Security and Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 deaths per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">This is just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories are still alive in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" animal político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the years after something is the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to exist further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to convert tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank wagon crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the trolley fell victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses enveloped including a cinemas nearby, which was full of people who looked at the football world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses incinerated and charred bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned for ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture titled" "" "This is Nigeria." "" "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrific scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was discovered several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic of atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count bodies," "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been pieced, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time was exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Boko Haram's attempt to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as it was mistakenly presented as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of depreciation; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further brings personal comments as this example wrongly falsifies the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning announcement, released by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, it appeared as the following, which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that falsely claimed that President Myanmar's Thein had said, monks and politicians had taken part in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar was admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image.</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retweeted), but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing is used to discuss how African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media, there are tens of people who have unintentionally contributed to drinking water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and does the real horror of what actually happened in the DRC, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal is equating to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible images of readers and viewers are desensitizing and the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media influence others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot of discussion about violent representations in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture may be somewhat sugger, which can also be detached from the context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sothesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase does not suffice, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes somewhat context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Study for your parents in recognition of how to care for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The comfort or laziness you feel after you get warmed in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds his own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They demise other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages" which are highly appreciated by Untranslatable are invited to upload their favorite wine here.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urbane language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unsettable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language from big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure places where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often" "" "to understand," "" "use these events instead" "" "to appreciate, to feel, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers create their history in their own language first and translate or then explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation make the audience aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konad takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of Hasen and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his flag, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, on 3 April 2017, various religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march launched in the Puertorican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, is dedicated to the # FreeBel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available here is a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the true costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our newsages and to make some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police" "" "had taken part in Adra as a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, its place of stay and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the conductor of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more than the work he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles merging with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel did not know at that time, that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be of invaluable value to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Typically, Bassel has not yet completed this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent all my life with it, dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English good.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has wondered. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners on how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a sample cloth she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambians responded with anger to a corruption incident where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence, on which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced in 2010 together with four other defendants due to pollution of 54 million Meals (approximately 800 000 euros) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public money from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was given Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, again to refer to his old posts as the company did not perform discipline proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants don't mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our judicial system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the impacting person.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently was silent and made no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also declines this behavior and considers the case as "irresistible":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would have been adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of which left half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has consented to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will be happy to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disproportionate!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already been so massively offended.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza want to return morality and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it only served itself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza uses the state as a handpiece to an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who has been reloaded and ultimately sentenced to a long term of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only remain in memory for ever as the first independent president, but also as sharp, incisive and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he affirmed that "an ambitious man was capable of everything, also to sell the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he does not change tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also dismissive:</seg>

<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or cautious socialism (in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in trying to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically generate hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burmesan words with different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spittbse), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarcaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the phrase ku la -" "" "Healing" "" "(ku) + the question face (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook Initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical before disseminating all posts that are suspected of disseminating racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"" "" "" "automatism will not understand what you write on factoring." ""</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who disseminate hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "while the action may send a strong signal to all those who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy doesn't last long." ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to keep track, posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the Post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have begun without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "hereditary curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fraudulent posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales, that would be great." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word "Kalar" not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which did not contain hate speech, but were nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word "Kalar."</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks seeks to heighten violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticized for his failure to control the proliferation of hate speech on his burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply censoring the word "Kalar," it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were already married with 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying the critics of the children's toe, they ought to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition ensured tension in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point there was no doubt whether the opposition would ever agree with the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who could be discussed, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle reposted to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously been approved in the Senate, the draft can now become law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who held a ministerial office in the ministry of education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has taken too much time and unnecessary talk which has concealed the heart of the matter, but know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>

<seg id="1377">While the general prosecutor Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said that it was quite lawful for Maharaj to act against the law, most of the social media users would wish to tackle the issue differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of holding the discussion so general, in a way that can only provoke panic and disgrace, if we, instead of speaking of the problem that the state, our daughters from it, would be misused, that they may be abused by large, hard-headed men who are opposed to them, "would you then be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children's marriage is legal or still the norm, although there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Through the mirroring of web pages Turkish users can look back to Wikipedia</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the US, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey is blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share reliable and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use dressing tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report from the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 has been held since the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror pages (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator links), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">In spite of legal prohibition, the content is irrevocable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything in place snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content on decentralized and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to watch at least all Wikipedia information, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrorpages when it is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy adress, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suboliant rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed out colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera on himself and to try to rectify the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called Navaraja (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Instantly I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to shoot pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood before the Tigers face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late at night. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush seemed to appear. he immediately sets off, we see ourselves and he gazes at me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to make recordings of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India women are avoiding the utmost care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to the social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should abject the norm to sustain this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was condemned by a false tribunal and rejected by her family and the village community after having contacted a married family by name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not to mention the name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, played a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them only where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawar has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage and to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in its discussion was of women who did not call their husbands by their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to talk about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands, is a custom that they all dutifully upheld and have never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini comments:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not conceive this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round about it.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent until the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women attempted to engage the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they all asked," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawar from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the crushing of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women may never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was just standing before him; another decided to release all the accumulated frustration against him and his family by curbing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the following days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law was staring her she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the cinnoberred dot on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the carcinogenic point if he did it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion during each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and spoke about things they had never imagined before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincerely about some things, for example as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Most of them are okay, but some wanted a Salwar-Kurta to wear a wide shirt over a pants; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice, morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly getting into the reels:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women rehearsed it a few times, but then they stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, make it still, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as haggling for more freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to only 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of abduction of flat-headed people for the organ trafficking, probably for religious purposes, troubled the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It gives local superstitions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia told the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on flat-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to a mission carried out in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to kahle men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, the Muslim police were following the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the Milange district, where the assassinations took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Huseigne Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police already mentioned the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes the shamans are involved in the death of bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of bald individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district of Moravia, province of Zambézia, for presumably aberring rituals, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the blogger poor Snaippa who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE would like to adopt A MOSAMBIK, THAT SICH ashamed a country where people would have shame to seek sex against good notes, and who would not hurt others or even take their lives to make their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald for superstitious purposes or "black magic" would be hunted.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The fall of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment), having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto demanding the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was shocked when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government reported that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer told AFP previously that Liu Mrs., Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk and contact someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished, led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Singapore. Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the International branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal' countries, in view of it, it appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre comes up from authoritarianism that pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-Answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred corresponding questions with Non-Answers of rational Art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our valued K Shanmugam would take the trouble clearing this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the whole host of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the codex.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unevenly important even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore is not a country," "" "he obviously does not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam who, as a leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemian statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard that I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that properly and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates the weaknesses of Shanmugham's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam" "" "googled a mistake" "" "or was it a joyful advocate?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country are the sovereign rights of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore make their military service, they only defend their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our prime minister pay invoices?</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop-band famous in Thailand has released a music video that parodides the Junta, who took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continue to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"" "the new song" "" "Dictator Girl" "" "(Phadet Girl) describes a young man who tells him what rules he makes his girlfriend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has pursued in the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta still pursues is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax evasion.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican girl, a small woman with a coral-pink grooved frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. Ramírez says, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Afrika?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys medicines that they cannot pay, they massaged them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him whether Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil already, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans speak already at Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards in order to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will get in touch with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mom Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "" "he says smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez says that her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has started helping them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other people also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled from people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single woman, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go next steps.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, travelers can consult their telephones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blows in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair lichens, who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices made in Xinjiang by Twitter users</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it tells the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive Radio Free Asia report, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police said that the app would identify and follow the terrorists' distribution channels, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic sites, online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remote control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine-based internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet, based on Twitter, released the censored news in China), published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers subsequently checked the residents as they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notifications required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected on a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of bondage by the contracting technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (Hazardous Resorts COUNTY COUNTS) also released a jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated organisations, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"" "the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" "" "terrorist videos" "".

<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he locks himself to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine-spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to flee from their village to Palestine where they had lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned off their tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as orialism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only in his hometown of Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that extend from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"" "" "" "even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he calls himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," Hdaib stresses.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think I'm a man," "" "while he poured into water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensing hot day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the dwarms of lukewarm coffee and the waist of the Kent cigarette in the nose are in the first place of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, one simply avoids having basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordaniens's Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou 'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "who continue to choose" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib reckoned to be traditional sex men, giving his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently clouded unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years Jordan has increased the number of 'Honorary morals' - the inofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings in 2016 reached its climax; however, it is still more difficult to support the institutional infrastructure to support women who have become victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of inner-family violence," "" "are held indefinitely in jail," "" "and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures, as well as the guarantee of the family that nothing will happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for not shy away from themes that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, that he does not separate his music, which is full of explicit abuses on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, Man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I became a politician," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "get what you want," whether faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online programme Roya, to see later that his comments were ripped out of the context, distorted and in his opinion censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals is not dishonest Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwas, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuvo, who later should work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the Board of Directors, with the reason they had voiced critical questions in social media about the problems that were deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has now fought with Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and innermost changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions and artificial kind of democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as it is, Hdaib will continue to coat more arms and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman listened to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the fortresses, drums and dancing have been passed over more than one thousand years ago, in which armies marched from the West of Japan to the Northeast to force the Indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to take a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only truth - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Often outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian people away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation like the one of the Friseurs.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where Street raub and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts meet each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice to receive training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities to offer, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported about some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Foto: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question went out to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), which encouraged young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signatory of the treaty of peace was so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There is still a long way before Kolumbians, until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric around the clock and now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for guerrilla fighters, must now resume their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian people had to join together and would have to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak to Kailash Satyarthi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He tarried so he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan came to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they did before in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of encouragement from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "" "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," "" "said Manuela Jiménez Avila." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answered a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly there ran the tears over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat next to the grenades.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was pity to be all the years of loyal companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else of life than war. to join FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there who waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war-controlled and the FARC acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the FARC leaders explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice worked on the part of the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing those people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings, who were turned upside by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - including those killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombianians were prophesied that after disarmament, peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, raise and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We at FARC now focus on peace, a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents made the lap through the whole WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was watching a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you honour the family, you make a spot?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had caught everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two catches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurses were you placed - in the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very thankful for him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some perfectly unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by passing through the streets; others wanted me to live in the official TV in Grosny and say that I hadn't changed my sex that everything was just a bad excuse, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body-size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with dark window panes and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked out the number plates - it turned out that I was tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without proof, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you're in safety, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you're stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really put effort to look like the person that she reminds of her past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who are dortefold?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so-called 'honor' has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are still gay men captured in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to turn to Kadyrov's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, but dipped in a purposeful way to radicalise himself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after growing beards.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was there when these people were taken with them.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports about it yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already familiar with Grosny before 2003, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, back then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia wanted to lead us to" "" "civilisation" "" "but eventually dropped us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Sharia has never even curved my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "soot is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yeah.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never insulted me, never hunted and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could sense how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who were laughed and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I returned home I could feel how the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, gatherings, I join them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves when I clap refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who wish to prophesy with foam before the mouth, that there are no boils among them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestans have which, the cabardins have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transigency to men who love men, and they believe that you change his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be accurate, different lifestyle settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab ancestor of Ahwazi in Iran, which is characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to raise the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after firing himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani Hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab ancestral Minority, and campaigners on the spot warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arabic Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large majority of the Arab ancestral communities live in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most abundant and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disease, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime deprives the Ahwazi Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region by drought, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm-industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youth rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazi who are looking for a job, the primary school completed, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the adjustment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab ancestor will be deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living from their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation to the ancestor and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists hit alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be feminist * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I get to speak on skin color, on black women, on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention what kind of body, psychological and verbally abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decided to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but they are all agreed that women - all women - should come together to" "" "lift up their voices and" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualised violence in addition to institutionalised forms of racial motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are facing a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have the same rights every time, all men and all men. on the other hand, I can not consider myself as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which relate both to the sex and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner said," "" "Am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a blending and marginalized being in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender, because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revere them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although inter-sectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to connect me to the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than being persistent for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (for example: Africa-Womanism: as we reclaim ourselves), we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life has neither passed, nor ignores, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissar told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts, but more cannot be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena showed for maltreatment, the acute indication of Ada Báez was not useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved back her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women permit an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who are ill-trafficking. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported at all in the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women are really ill-treated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 women were indicted for domestic violence at the District Prosecutor's Office. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements because of domestic violence in peace courts. here, too, 86% of women's ads arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were abused physically, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's ministerial Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who refunded in Paraguay because of mental ill-treatment, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "to every woman who refuses for bodily maltreatment, two women who do not do this come to the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since there is no criminal offence in Paraguay, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he would ever raise his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which does not originate from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner mistreated her.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: firstly, there are many medicines and vaccines missing in the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment to research these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the bian health system.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredness, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further on breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents argue not only for single varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as cereals or carton varieties. because of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food safety are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition Morton still breeds a salad, but it takes longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to dull." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far to salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they withstand trial, no one can breed a new type of salads because all features are already patented. "so he is doing as good as possible and tries to breed the traits he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative für" "" "Open-Source" "" "seeds) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they were bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it so as to breed their own varieties, and not immediately to find it - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects for the future</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg have control over the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds," he says, and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, as it is offered in August and September 2016. "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available freely. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is incessantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it either not or only difficult for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are still not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massive cultivated plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than salads or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of the point of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they have targeted properties - from those through which their taste or color improves all the way they thrive in certain environments and to withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is declining more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto discerns that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genital fluctuations and the cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is responsible for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts the view, however, that intellectual property preserves other breeders as patents and the protection of plant varieties encourage innovation. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not hinder innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait until a patent can detach, certainly not encourage innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if one has to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle has already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "but the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward and it will make us impossible if we will not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall Morton interfered with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we don't really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are used mass-based herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, it creates the most small seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding-garden.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship goals in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th of August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains bt- despite this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now. ANHRI confirm that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockage and not to yield.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first licensed site of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page of Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar's Al Jazeera network due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web pages for victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is no access to Egypt in the blog of columnist and human rights scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes non-accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is also home to Ziadas blog, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting the student protests and taking up a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blog is probably not significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a siege; an arrest, a tempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an impact, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (Afte) Egyptian authorities shut down websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etiletat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Aisons also documented the blocking of providers, by switching Internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Aisons talked about their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is worsened in addition to the fact that the censal decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in the favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day by day newspapers in all Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot at school," "" "Every second day a police officer will assassinate in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Diebe smokes Pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violent wave reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So the newspaper "Extra" published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August, "This is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision declared the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper says that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" mean more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against the violence as a "war." this is in view of a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible persons in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, enlightenment and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A peace march in Niterói in the state of Rio de Janeiro in honor of the murdered cultural organizer Rafael Lage.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">"" "according to statistics from 2015 in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the killings per federal state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It belongs to the company Globo, the largest media enterprise in South America, which, as Cecília emphasizes, has been repeating the state security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by using a massive police blogger and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for a few years, however, after several reports on Schikanen and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, the UPP was increasingly under bombardment.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux comments from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the Rio authorities do not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"" "" "" "in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a drag list is an unsharper point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "crazy balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War on or around, fact is that the people of the favelas in Rio will continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police clause the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are currently in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition, based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by Assad's regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these territories controlled by rebels have been under siege outside Damascus, causing inhabitants to be locally produced or controlled by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and academics instructed the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and perform the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive dietary source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The director of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because you can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reported Global Voices that had been struggling to announce this project for three years and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more "to gain awareness."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To raise money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of planting fungi, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to raise funds on cando by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "" "production of fungal seeds originating from the regions" "", "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this was possible, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi throughout East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on October 21 in many regional capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were grassed in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and approximately 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government called for a national mourning for the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the region of Galicia in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire quarries spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which oversees forest areas by satellite images, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Federal Association of farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building permits are questioned in places with high fire risk.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought up after severe fires in 2003 and 2005, was requested by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"" "" "" "the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity to fall, if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open rear door, so that everything could be built," "" "João Sorval carries on in the same article from the newspaper Público."

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of easily flammable wood, like in a vicious circle, spread to the fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used fogos.pt for its own civil protection data and informs the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the server didn't withstand the storm of the 400,000 users who were tracking the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the fall of 1994 the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. so Afghanistan was a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't say it then, she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy was supposed to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara were suddenly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred of the Hazara came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharper found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a couple of years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Ashareh was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who distributed food to help in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high demand quotas, Italy is a second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions stipulating asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The civil rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centers." "" "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they formally filed an application for asylum - which can still go for months after registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">06.11.2015 | Vampire Diaries</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his reluctant lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry, Asharaf stuck its entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the subject of documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans have been operating, including tailoring, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashark's goals go far beyond the Italian gastronomic industry and retailers and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>

<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "in this way, they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Never Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use social networks within six months following a successful decision on the website of the authority, stating their full name and identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the triggering of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the law, which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament, is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be debated there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "May a further member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal to introduce tougher sanctions for the insults of the president or a high official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the legislative proposal, such action would, however, be punished with prison and money penalties, such as legal experts at Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who had demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan, as more than 700 protest participants, had been arrested for four years in custody for four years in custody.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his hearing was postponed to 20 May, because the prison administration failed, according to human rights groups, to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is facing the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree on the charges of arms, illegal assembly, murder and murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-barbary. they were charged for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adasiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly backed a controversial bill, which would ensure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption accused officers amnesty, if they return all unlawful monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat sheds light on how the pressial plans for supporting the legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia declined the nomination of his sources, indicating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists were entitled to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the regulations that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that by eliminating anonymer comments in substitutions within social networks, it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have suggested in social media to selectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizens' journalism and independence.</seg>
