that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times Repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he released spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation , in which the CIA was literally explo@@ iting Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t fall ?
the US government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against cr@@ acks and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this turn he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condem@@ n and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are giving .
so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had years for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government in the cr@@ acks were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of separ@@ ating and bringing tears to statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are secre@@ tly worried about his phone messages ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit information , and even travel references with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , CIA @-@ whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and tears .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his appearance . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work classi@@ fies .
since 11 September almost every article about national security was the result of whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just like the government &apos;s technology allows re@@ por@@ ters to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that has not yet been written when cr@@ acks had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post Office .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , for which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot secre@@ tly proc@@ ure information and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ age technologies that are all je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have the option of bringing mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer .
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environ@@ ment@@ alist who strikes alarm for sigh@@ ted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der that war@@ ns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data storage of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that Rei@@ che and M@@ ighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax hav@@ ens &#93; . &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to the very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release , and wait for the next un@@ veiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians see how secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka cap .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these don@@ ors .
it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
pres@@ um@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle of which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a bit of data from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , some US states need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school@@ children off .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to zoom in particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent an investig@@ ative investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a home , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all up to a lawyer told our investig@@ ators how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about a single peak politicians involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we need to change the rules of rules .
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult .
this may sound very absurd , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I realize that something has started to change .
over the past few years , we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies .
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been cap@@ turing in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind here .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end through laws these kinds of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the transparency which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red ma@@ iden .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace deal , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get into my bed ?
a wild bo@@ ar sle@@ eps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed , sne@@ e@@ zing on to@@ e tips to the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he bought from me hang@@ s today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold as stran@@ gers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress became normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ omm@@ ate attracts and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and each morning breakfast .
Ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; Air Mat@@ tresses and Breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came to the re@@ els .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room , whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you get to know the things you can do . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we wanted .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting barn .
this soft touch of panic you can now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
for this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please tell us on Twitter that he is candidate for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had only imagined with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ g@@ ments that all say : &quot; he really can hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system significantly boo@@ sts trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ g@@ ments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had left their convi@@ ctions before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ g@@ ments .
if you have less than three jud@@ g@@ ments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you say too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le Art@@ works in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design , to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to submit these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not covered before .
for us , the business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything is running smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or devast@@ ate homes .
hosts have guests left in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only one fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had ever been a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , there can be miracles .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgement :
&quot; perfect home for travellers who are pr@@ one to heart attacks based on sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know it properly .
they drive one in their own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books by .
they can stay one even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing fit with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the matter is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy shows a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it &apos;s easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for that .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in every place you visit , a group there would be a@@ wat@@ ering to complete a thoroughly ref@@ illing and showing a neighborhood pub that you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities which enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were offered to residents . students who were looking for a residence ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were de@@ duc@@ ted . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hospitality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also available before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why has it worked ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it ast@@ o@@ unding ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think about me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or suppres@@ sed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
pres@@ um@@ ably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted passi@@ vely believing my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought , ques@@ tioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves it somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began as all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ meldung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people j@@ umped from the buildings .
what was that ?
to have an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bing Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into a susp@@ ect .
the same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start building studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how I was silent -- as deep as we went into my seat , and I was first afraid to be recognized as Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings were listening : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were held for Muslims , distor@@ ted and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I &apos;ve got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to have to explain itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , educ@@ ators and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be some parking spaces , but do not stop terror .
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to people of other faith more toler@@ ant and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ c@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ c@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radi@@ c@@ alization process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their families so that the extrem@@ ity group is capable of bra@@ in@@ washing , causing the person to believe that the terrorists are true Muslims , and anyone who det@@ ests their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radi@@ c@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a non@@ violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS states its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imagination , if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one thro@@ ws a look at them , they are not driven to what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pret@@ ended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that made sense to her rage , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this I@@ mam re @-@ establishes the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que guar@@ ded her to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more likely to accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that when one examines test@@ ers in which negative about Muslims was reported , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you see when the mood against Muslims rises above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ ines all of us .
in the assignment of collective blame it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , much promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he laugh@@ ed eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son at the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , and put off my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was holding me up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the I@@ mam opened an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who were come not to attack us , but to join us .
at that moment , I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind@@ set , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the biggest study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
if people like an exception tend to appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a b@@ ast@@ erer &apos;s platform is about becoming a milli@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before the air package reached our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting , flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build up self @-@ elev@@ ating structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the highest level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rear @-@ starter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fli@@ pper trying to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ äu@@ gl@@ ern it can float , and therefore has great advantages for start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ ts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in which position the optimal position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often present fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts that gather to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled air@@ planes , which only had two mo@@ vable parts : one propeller and a stern ru@@ der .
recently we discovered that flies with only one work .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ serving flight device .
it has only one mo@@ vable part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room over all@@ u@@ vial .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . in order to bring it to flying , I must throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in slo@@ wn@@ ess , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cope with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thus he receives the Extra@@ ordinary Ab@@ ility ,
moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are available in models , the rest is learned directly at flying .
let &apos;s take a look at this .
if flight machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin propeller aircraft .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance car .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fall@@ out , the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly further , if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial Micro Quad@@ copter -- each single weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine to dr@@ ills would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
about 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled around each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three s@@ uns converted into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they glo@@ wed bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the entire universe known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first time .
about 1.3 billion years ago , more cel@@ esti@@ al life on earth was originated .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of especially Mu@@ eller -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which develop through colli@@ ding black holes .
most did they think crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the det@@ ecting was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ uted the two colli@@ ding black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my death @-@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their by observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a housing in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other .
for illustration , teachers in short courses lead to the theory of rel@@ ativity as often a truly authentic dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stolen by the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , one declared the Lig@@ o employees crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than one thous@@ and@@ th of a nucle@@ us of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you .
in tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
the face of your child for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity , a lot can tell us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott occupies himself very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ ping : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies quickly , one h@@ ears the same cross with an additional key change . that sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vo@@ cabulary , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- A Date That at least I will never forget -- Hear@@ ts Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rot@@ ate about as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we heard it .
in this there is the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ies explo@@ de stars in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about space from them .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through , as these are opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by his own night @-@ light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back right up to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that all things exist that we have never seen , which we never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the type of stars that bring out black holes like Lig@@ o watch them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the din@@ osau@@ rs for our arch@@ e@@ ological work .
lig@@ o makes us a completely different point of view of the events of the universe , the emergence of the stars , and in the end also on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start acting ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just to do what I feared , elimin@@ ating my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if it were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the leap . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the beginning
a new life attitude in my family . from then on I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sag@@ a to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things out , bring you to life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream job . &quot; &quot;
no . no .
I am a Titan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream job . &quot; &quot;
I create television . I produce TV .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days sometimes four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously in production , four , 16 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run succ@@ essi@@ vely on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I created myself and not only produced , so even above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world .
do you know who else does that ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream job . &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work , so you understand that I am not just walking around the computer and fant@@ asi@@ zing , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ en my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
in such a way , one toler@@ ates a high sound , delivering a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , stres@@ s@@ ful and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and disturb@@ ing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people assume if I declare to them the sum that I am persu@@ aded to write that writing is a joy for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum -- when I started working with TV production , when I started working and working , building , creating , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum then you cannot strive for size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called Ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more epis@@ odes , the more hi@@ ber@@ ed boundaries , the more work there are , the more things are watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this sum . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ stressed , over@@ stated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work institute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess I want to go to Sh@@ onda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ anas .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums ceased .
the total amount of the engine was logged .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my sum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ anen @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sle@@ eps not , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , stupid Author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you work , you love what you &apos;re doing , to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you a bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when you stop the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is that happening ?
I hate it when I &apos;m titanium and my bu@@ zz is smoking , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , can you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of thum@@ b , I can do nothing except to fit up .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is going to release , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door is going on and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz slowly comes back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is here .
not the bu@@ zz but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the sums of employment , the titanium ring , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I make this a solid rule so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ a@@ holic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working in the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person pre@@ fers to be than to be home ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we ro@@ am around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always look for my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live and the sum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the games ?
you can also do it ! always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit will replace me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and speak my teen@@ y daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood @-@ day !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to work .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the bu@@ zz to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about fun ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is doing well for you .
find it out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;ll win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ ming .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the sum of labour is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s nice to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem is playing .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sum@@ ming : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things out , I awake you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures .
they certainly have one of the best known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in doing this , one can im@@ plant an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the destiny of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , suffered under severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief practition@@ er and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with trau@@ ma @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and the skull pressure increases .
to save life , one has to reduce the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is similar to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , moisture and environments to thri@@ ve .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , it managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ um cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however , -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did in Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them far@@ blich in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the final step , we performed it at the t@@ apping point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we made an injury to and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vit@@ ro , in the culture dy@@ ed .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feeding p@@ ellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
as they had achieved a stable skill level , we injured in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex the motor skills range .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , they spontan@@ eously recovered to some degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkeys that spontan@@ eously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now you see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after mat@@ uring .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill approximately two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it already takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ entri@@ c study .
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable mit@@ es .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved dou@@ bt@@ lessly that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling in us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group consider a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future bl@@ asts , and our great new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the topic of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit par@@ ado@@ x &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the school denberg who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt of debt ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy spar@@ ks and corporations , who are too anx@@ ious to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one would wear the debt and also produce all the things that humanity urg@@ ently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ame the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low total economic demand , which fear@@ ing the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who would not invest in which they do not invest . just like O@@ di@@ pus &apos;s father , who would be fear@@ ful , the proph@@ ecy of the or@@ acle could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally causes the circumstances that lead to the fact that Ö@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
its extremely wast@@ eful article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to advance our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally concluded too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it applied the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political participation with the same voting in question of the state &apos;s interests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been long -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle lit very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
but today our liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy - i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democratic one .
in today &apos;s democr@@ acies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , the economy gradually emig@@ rated to politics and dis@@ em@@ powered them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not about de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because the government can now be in the government and still not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alised politics itself , that it is deteri@@ or@@ ating itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality decl@@ ines , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring back politics and the economy back , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ret@@ ains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the teaching of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms reg@@ ain only through a miracle a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem with this is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste is more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts lower , as it is already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re @-@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical conqu@@ ests he produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia similar to that of &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the company in &quot; Star Trek , &quot; in which machines are used to serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; to indul@@ ge in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the business sector , please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and revenues come from and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
there is no distinction between those who are owned by companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but they do not belong there . no more exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no prot@@ ru@@ ding twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy , please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity .
imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; into units of &quot; cos@@ mos , &quot; and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ als , in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , globally Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno ban@@ ani PRO@@ MET@@ H@@ EU@@ S Hip @-@ Short
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein , who said that . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China , and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , in the area where most of them play -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some ways , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can see now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the ninet@@ eenth century , sm@@ ells enormous according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure many listen@@ ers are curious about their experiences as Greece &apos;s finance minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I warned that this is coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BG : yes ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you look back for the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive exploitation line was going through the euro@@ zone and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal , which by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
it is right to do it . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , still have chosen the den@@ ial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ernst ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in a so ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the len@@ ders &apos; side to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
they merely wanted to drop our government , just because they did not want to deal with the disp@@ arities that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the financi@@ ers imposed on us by this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the liber@@ ated cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to beat the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you will be wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an ion@@ izer and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for watching the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this bend .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the site IMDB . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after watching a s@@ quad@@ ron , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to for@@ bid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle pay@@ out , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight .
so he has to make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon makes something so Roy Price wants nothing to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online , where everyone can look at them for free .
and if Amazon thro@@ ws things out for free , do you pick up , right ?
millions of viewers watch these epis@@ odes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when looking at these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or watch again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process this and it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a bit different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went through a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data accomplished companies .
they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by a very powerful computer .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit start@@ ling because we live in a time where we can take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail in the United States and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can predi@@ ct out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the worst kind , through data analysis of the Google searches .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as deciding on cancer therapy
over the years I have realized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , do two things :
first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , use the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we have it all : our brain .
if there is something where the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to sit together again , even if the information is incomplete to then make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to . however , the decision on how to take all of these pieces back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , than they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will look at it later with a technical demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little more wis@@ er than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data is still paying off , making decisions to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
