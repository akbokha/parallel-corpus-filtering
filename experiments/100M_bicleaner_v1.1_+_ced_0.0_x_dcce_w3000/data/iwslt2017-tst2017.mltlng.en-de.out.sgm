<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he released spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret service, in which the CIA was literally exploiting Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years, the government has determined against cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to condemn and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are giving.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had years for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government in the cracks were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and bringing tears to statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, are secretly worried about his phone messages,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit information, and even travel references with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA-whistleblower and tears.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his appearance. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work classifies.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September almost every article about national security was the result of whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the government's technology allows reporters to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet been written when cracks had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post Office.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, for which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot secretly procure information and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">It's up to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have the option of bringing misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about grievances in the care of soldiers and report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmentalist who strikes alarm for sighted water of Flint. or a Wall street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data storage of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that Reiche and Mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens]. [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release, and wait for the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians see how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoshka cap.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these donors.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle of which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a bit of data from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some US states need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip schoolchildren off.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to zoom in particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an investigative investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a home, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all up to a lawyer told our investigators how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single peak politicians involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we need to change the rules of rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very absurd, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I realize that something has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen suggestions for more transparency concerning the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been capturing in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end through laws these kinds of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the transparency which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red maiden.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace deal, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get into my bed?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild boar sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed, sneezing on toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress became normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate attracts and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new mates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "Air Mattresses and Breakfast" [Airbed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the reels.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room, whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you get to know the things you can do. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we wanted.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting barn.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic you can now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">For this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he is candidate for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had only imagined with his name; if he had told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgments that all say: "he really can hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system significantly boosts trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had left their convictions before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you say too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother." "" "-- the request will not be accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I make a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design, to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to submit these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything is running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or devastate homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests left in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only one fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had ever been a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, there can be miracles.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travellers who are prone to heart attacks based on sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know it properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in their own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing fit with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is just" "" "rental industry" "", "the matter is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy shows a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it's easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic for that.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place you visit, a group there would be awatering to complete a thoroughly refilling and showing a neighborhood pub that you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents. students who were looking for a residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were deducted. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"" "" "" "hospitality" "" "was also available before." ""</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it astounding,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think about me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-fitness fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively believing my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, educators and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking spaces, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to people of other faith more tolerant and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their families so that the extremity group is capable of brainwashing, causing the person to believe that the terrorists are true Muslims, and anyone who detests their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a nonviolent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS states its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when one throws a look at them, they are not driven to what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that made sense to her rage, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-establishes the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque guarded her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more likely to accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that when one examines testers in which negative about Muslims was reported, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"" "" "" "if you see when the mood against Muslims rises above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it the first, but the toxic air of fear shines all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective blame it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>

<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son at the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">"" "" "" "I took him out, and put off my shoes, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw was holding me up." ""</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam opened an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were come not to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe?</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a mindset with draught, working in a noble mindset, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the biggest study of Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want wealth for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception tend to appear, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a basterer's platform is about becoming a milliard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air package reached our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up self-elevating structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be" "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "" "on the highest level." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"" "this is a so-called" "" "rear-starter" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="422">A flipper trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrflügler, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the Starräuglern it can float, and therefore has great advantages for start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind guts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in which position the optimal position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often present fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for example as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled airplanes, which only had two movable parts: one propeller and a stern ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with only one work.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-serving flight device.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room over alluvial.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. in order to bring it to flying, I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in slowness, this machine is here, the Omnicope with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the Extraordinary Ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are available in models, the rest is learned directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance car.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fallout, the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial Micro Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine to drills would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns converted into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they glowed brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">About 1.3 billion years ago, more celestial life on earth was originated.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of especially Mueller -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the caltech -- to search for gravitational-waves, which develop through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most did they think crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser interferometer gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detecting was commissioned, the gravitational waves routed the two colliding black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their by observatories like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a housing in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, teachers in short courses lead to the theory of relativity as often a truly authentic dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational shafts are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stolen by the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. therefore, one declared the Ligo employees crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than one thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, a lot can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott occupies himself very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirping: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies quickly, one hears the same cross with an additional key change. that sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- A Date That at least I will never forget -- Hearts Ligo: [Surrender sound] Somebody who knows what to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which rotate about as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masseries explode stars in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about space from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through, as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by his own night-light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back right up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that all things exist that we have never seen, which we never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the type of stars that bring out black holes like Ligo watch them are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaurs for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us a completely different point of view of the events of the universe, the emergence of the stars, and in the end also on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "before whom I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>

<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start acting?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just to do what I feared, eliminating my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>

<seg id="584">I create television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days sometimes four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programmes that I created myself and not only produced, so even above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">"" "" "" "dream job." "</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think, when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I'm talking about work, so you understand that I am not just walking around the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that it's not dreaming with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepen my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">In such a way, one tolerates a high sound, delivering a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, stressful and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume if I declare to them the sum that I am persuaded to write that writing is a joy for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sum -- when I started working with TV production, when I started working and working, building, creating, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum then you cannot strive for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more hibered boundaries, the more work there are, the more things are watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overstressed, overstated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "I guess I want to go to Shonda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby tianas.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The total amount of the engine was logged.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My summing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as usual: the same Titanen-work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium sleeps not, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Today, stupid Author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do, you work, you love what you're doing, to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you a buzz when you know the buzz when you stop the buzz when the buzz stops, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says:" "" "mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to all and secondly, she didn't call me "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no more" "" "estimating" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I'm titanium and my buzz is smoking, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, can you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of thumb, I can do nothing except to fit up.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is going to release, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is going on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is here.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the sums of employment, the titanium ring, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with broadcasts and TV-hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a solid rule so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">"" "" "" "I don't know how to work." ""</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working in the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We roam around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>

<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the best known, the "deep-brain stimulation." in doing this, one can implant an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffered under severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was chief practitioner and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with trauma-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that the brain swells the brain with skull-brain trauma and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is similar to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, moisture and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did in Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them farblich in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step, we performed it at the tapping point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we made an injury to and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in the culture dyed.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feeding pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they had achieved a stable skill level, we injured in the motoric cortex the motor skills range.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recovered to some degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at some degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after maturing.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicentric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable mites.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proved doubtlessly that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is dwindling in us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup consider a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are brighter, our future blasts, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the school denberg who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy sparks and corporations, who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one would wear the debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflame the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low total economic demand, which fearing the pessimism of investors, who would not invest in which they do not invest. just like Odipus's father, who is from fear, the prophecy of the oracle could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances that lead to the fact that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely wasteful article All the unproductive capital should be used to advance our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally concluded too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it applied the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political participation with the same voting in question of the state's interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy has not been long --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle lit very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">But today our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy - i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democratic one.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, the economy gradually emigrated to politics and disempowered them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because the government can now be in the government and still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which it nourished, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has so far cannibalised politics itself, that it is deteriorating itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the inequality declines, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring back politics and the economy back, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms regain only through a miracle a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem with this is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste is more sublime, and social conflicts lower, as it is already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to re-shape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film" "" "matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical conquests he produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia similar to that of "matrix," or something similar to the company in "Star Trek," in which machines are used to serve human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," to indulge in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "what would it be like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of" "" "Matrix" "" "similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business sector, please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues come from and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those who are owned by companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but they do not belong there. no more exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no protruding twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," into units of "cosmos," and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberals, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno banani PROMETHEUS Hip-Short</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>

<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>

<seg id="1008">It is right to do it. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, still have chosen the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slender, has an ionizer and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for watching the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the site IMDB. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" Game of Thrones, "" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a squadron, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like Toddlers and Tiaras -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to forbid" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle payout, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it's the first time that Amazon makes something so Roy Price wants nothing to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online, where everyone can look at them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon throws things out for free, do you pick up, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed when looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or watch again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact they collect the data, process this and it results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went through a car and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data accomplished companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit startling because we live in a time where we can take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the United States and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company such as Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of influenza, the worst kind, through data analysis of the Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as deciding on cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have realized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the items; as a second, use the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something where the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to sit together again, even if the information is incomplete to then make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to. however, the decision on how to take all of these pieces back together and make a show like "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, than they chose" "" "Alpha House" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will look at it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a little more wiser than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data is still paying off, making decisions to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
