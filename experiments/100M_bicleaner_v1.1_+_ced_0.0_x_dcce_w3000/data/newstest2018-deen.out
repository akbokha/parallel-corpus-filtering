Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a mine chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everybody who had to get exciting , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green me@@ adow instead of a walk @-@ in road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria in the state government , are anything but up to date - but therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one cannot recognize as such .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the big overview map , detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blätter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were incorporated for cities and communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were developed according to the Bavarian sur@@ vey@@ ing administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and the first sur@@ vey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned Bavaria &apos;s top@@ ographic recording - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally with@@ drawn with the Peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ vey@@ ing administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt for Munich origin@@ ates from 18@@ 56 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison to earlier / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the drawing of the map , i.e. 1877 , as a district of Munich .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the zo@@ oming a small @-@ scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered plots of the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ gency &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots present no farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete jungle .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt , in the area of the present district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen we read not only street names &quot; am Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the &quot; On the Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once again blocked people with del@@ usions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard of Gud@@ run headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who is brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , and later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the central sir@@ ens in hair 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich east , east of residential buildings dating back to the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Haupt Platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line will take place .
with the sli@@ ders the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publish@@ es travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to promote coloured people has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , demands af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based inci@@ dents occur in the entire state and are noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recent law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state , which di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that people happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no longer any gasoline during the voyage and was put into cust@@ ody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without acc@@ using a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whit@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring about che@@ wing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted about 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime reporting program that classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the states committed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further race @-@ r@@ acial profil@@ ing in view of the AC@@ LU .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to specific laws and trends within the US .
Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ project is elementary
the Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue next year .
the C@@ DU Par@@ liament@@ ary Or@@ ders Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have obtained a picture on site .
at the square of the Schwen@@ demann family , representatives of the C@@ DU local community met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann initially gave insights into his operation , in which he cultivated 55 acres of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommod@@ ated in five apartments holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative solution for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fischer@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the crossover project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the green area care for a lot of work , much must be mach@@ ined with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ event@@ h operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not run a bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
hope that the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation of the faces could be with@@ drawn for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced .
the storage area is therefore 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested until at least 2023 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by a leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac emphas@@ ised : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers &apos; wives it is not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape path directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state funding of soft f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the black forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the enclosed area must not be trac@@ ed man@@ age@@ able ( slope above 35 percent ) and therefore must be threatened by the challenge .
for the 2018 Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build up almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the storage area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have landed him if he had done it .
but it interven@@ ed , and in particular the significance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta described : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here for a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem on which you refer to which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your rub@@ b@@ ish , your arms , and your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the poor waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living apost@@ asy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in the USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a depic@@ ting classic image portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she has a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism that the American flame puts into the re@@ claimed world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see her as she was seen by the exhau@@ sting , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to recognize .
their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power .
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish Members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power governor of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member sch@@ ot@@ tic cont@@ ingent in the World Championship cad@@ re will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special is developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth World Championships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ ts are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was supposed to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle rec@@ alls her first world champion@@ ships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in the medals and fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate colleagues voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as an established ath@@ l@@ ete , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dium .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to sit on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block@@ age Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not engage in a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate vot@@ ers .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he was sc@@ ared of criticism , sure .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans Members have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained to him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rig@@ orous compliance with the principles .
he was also very sk@@ il@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and to play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
this is why the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum - is considered official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans MEP Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of silence or sp@@ amm@@ ing or hat@@ eful people who wave the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the past@@ or cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bri@@ mming , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ p@@ ses and to arrest or silence prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ LU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous Let@@ ters proposed his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , were overwhel@@ med by the historic documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comforts , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian organiz@@ es the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year leading to the final round at the Arch@@ er@@ field Festival before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ erry did a great job when he set this place .
he is an ard@@ ent suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because it was taken out of the programme in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion at home .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died on lung cancer because of passi@@ vity .
this is the result of scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there were more than 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than pres@@ umed , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which constantly hin@@ ders construction works , is a major problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to transit .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold country
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the troubled Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually refers to a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ coal tu@@ ber with free@@ zing , un@@ washed hands is taken and eng@@ ul@@ fed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her no fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule turned to the government of Jak@@ arta , which keeps control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is deser@@ ted . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs , which were transformed by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort estimated the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ uan demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprison@@ ed by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 .
Mass@@ ent@@ ö@@ tungen in Pap@@ u@@ as Stamm@@ es@@ hoch@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s became a genocide in line with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Advertising Any@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of Bris@@ b@@ ane in 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as non @-@ legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ magnetic strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal supp@@ ression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week has occurred , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher on Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bolts have intensi@@ fied because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ esian war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who went to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has tast@@ ed the native Pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jo@@ ko@@ wi , promised to tackle the ine@@ qualities and the infr@@ in@@ gements of the Pap@@ ua during his election in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total of 29 areas of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little changed , and today the locals feel dec@@ eived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ wi in 2014 , with the expectation that He will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ wis &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them they should turn off their spot@@ lights .
one of the soldiers shot their sound and later returned with four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they carried the cerem@@ onial hunting arches and introduced the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ singing - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to@@ wing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official TIME document that has not been released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and challenged the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the por@@ ch of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ f was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans bears a name , TIME in dark spirits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Che@@ fin@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ por@@ ters said that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station only because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , commission@@ er P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ sty@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news on the kill@@ ings came only on the next day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; by Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jo@@ ko@@ wi in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he submitted an extra@@ judicial mechanism to susp@@ end historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90@@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto opened a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , indic@@ ted by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ victims received such alle@@ g@@ ations with fier@@ ce dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to become arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police shot down vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ i Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said the vill@@ agers were waiting for officers who re@@ acted by fir@@ ing war@@ nings .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly included here , so the TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a call for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by joining spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into cust@@ ody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , having arrived at Nab@@ ire Airport since the opening of new airports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua seldom have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tri@@ bal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ champ were de@@ ported to Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ ko@@ wis have been campaig@@ ning to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election to 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not be right again for Jo@@ ko@@ wi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jo@@ ko@@ wi to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jo@@ ko@@ wi as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need any money , they only want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of an victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lo@@ wered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ er from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire , swe@@ eping through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units were ext@@ ingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said it work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
keine Davis @-@ Cup @-@ Reform : weiter Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has won his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup sing@@ les on two winning sets was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also therefore highly este@@ emed five @-@ sentence classic remain the traditional competition thus preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , it wasn &apos;t until the vote before the proposal came about to leave the final on a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host law in the next round in the next round of the year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers delivers prohibited objects to the aircraft , finds out a survey
a survey conducted among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously forbidden items are sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently carrying kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they had later discovered that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people - made by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items passed by T@@ SA agents were food and flu@@ ids .
more than 3 percent contributed to kno@@ w@@ ingly worn articles with clin@@ ici@@ ans by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately banned banned drugs in the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally had sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed by airport security and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA rules are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids can carry them with them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while the people thought that T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k delighted with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far been propos@@ ing that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less brilliant number for the first time at the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has had more than 500@@ ,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery just starts .
now Mus@@ k cleared : of the 5@@ 18@@ .000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 had already been with@@ drawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is simply non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 USD and in the United Kingdom 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; Reservation payment &quot; fully back .
currently 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations en@@ vis@@ age , Mus@@ k cleared in a telephone conference with analysts .
the Tes@@ la CEO , however , does not believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ .000 vehicles .
2018 illustrate how the market is set to change . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , unprecedented production lines without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are more delays , then the balance of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from dro@@ pping in flo@@ cks .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ drew due to the delay of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of state @-@ owned environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about a time that went off on October 1st to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was a prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma prior to his appointment , was for a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulation , to which the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels have been rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the Group &apos;s regular roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA car@@ et@@ aker exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces EPA &apos;s willingness to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely ful@@ fillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to uph@@ old the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then waited to set up an appointment for the execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who compl@@ ained about the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority which gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the statement issued by the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a draft law approved last month should delay the implementation of 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York Public Prosec@@ utor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who had lam@@ ented the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York opened in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil Oz@@ on is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about retirement surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturb@@ ing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ berg celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos;s Church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the jubil@@ ee of the church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 at 16 : 30 .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the resort , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ bl@@ gens their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini stres@@ ses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village Klein@@ od . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , there was also a glorious courtyard beside the former parish church , to which the church or patron was right and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the village and Ober@@ dorf , which today are still recogni@@ zable in the town picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the most beautiful settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 are under@@ lining these historical conditions .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age was formed from the Early Medi@@ eval Church Law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new past@@ or to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two gr@@ abs at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bell sections were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops enc@@ amped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remn@@ ants of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower could be left .
in the New Year &apos;s sn@@ akes in 18@@ 34 a storm turned the ste@@ ep@@ le and half fell .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower wer@@ g existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em have maintained the Hil@@ arius system as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ bl@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is made by the com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ tei@@ s .

the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade there is a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers highlight the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ bling and hearing @-@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ bl@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , such as ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini .
association wants to test Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ dern authorization
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no legal requirement for the construction and therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordered Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( C@@ DU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette there could not have been approved wind turbines , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind @-@ force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fru@@ g@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had agreed a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier due to a change in the land use plan - but it had not authorized the district government Düsseldorf , because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still illegal , and therefore also withdraw , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council renewed the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been in the district Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her to consider the matter again .
however , they do not pres@@ um@@ ably lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express itself in terms of the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied . &quot;
the NEW Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , on which the City of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashed : woman dies at a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in a mort@@ al manner .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road was closed for hours .
after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied her passenger with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and retail@@ er plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city center .
the commercial association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to attract the residents to the shopping tour in the city center .
like the president of the Gewerbe@@ ver@@ eins , Christian König , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; -@@ weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket product .
thus , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market , is planned .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets residents of the city and the closer region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action @-@ weekend , so Christian König .
the municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus , the commercial association and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ hold , with sal@@ v@@ aged Sunday , talks with all tra@@ ders and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and wai@@ ver on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the inner city while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment the city center - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
it was to be able to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which made itself partly wider , had told king in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day will take part in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
at a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them hard .
according to the fire brig@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
a person died when part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing later was also found dead later .
the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a mis@@ fortune , the authorities suspected the work on a gas pipeline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time of the holiday there were only a few people in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building .
tr@@ ump made after tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president im@@ pl@@ ored him , because he publicly den@@ oun@@ ced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and to make sure to pay Mexico for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that there was a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade expressed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said to Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury sail@@ ed through a group of viewers in the Monroe , Georgia , and went to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block their way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strip @-@ suit - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es tore the silence as a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only one post@@ mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience beat very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were bred by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indic@@ ted for the mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of post@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the Georgia State and a life @-@ long civil rights lawyer .
for him , the post@@ ure serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that a wrong one has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician puts a blank@@ et on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process were suspected .
but none was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent White Land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they went away from the prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspir@@ acy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is form@@ ulating it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual succession of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for almost a decade .
their representation is descrip@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are faced with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the Rest of Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Green Co @-@ director here .
he played the role of the chief cl@@ an member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room played the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cri@@ es up H@@ ester and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cona inv@@ okes the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ er@@ ted and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gl@@ asting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers we@@ ather@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and precisely here the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona speaks the N word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , kis@@ ses and then still@@ ness .
a woman clo@@ thed with a sad@@ ness is about the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays g@@ rief &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced nearly eight hours of Georgi@@ an aff@@ licted humidity when Broo@@ ks kid@@ n@@ apped them on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial places of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels so@@ ber@@ table .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the bog@@ us blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona bu@@ ds two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in her arms we@@ eping , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , the audience sit together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta ads talking about the reproduction with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski struggl@@ ed to find words which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Jackson holds court at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ure is inspiring in a way , as it describes the horror of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a multi @-@ fac@@ eted production on a gigantic , six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ady street corner with a m@@ ason@@ ry and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; paste and el@@ aste &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .

the audience thanks it to the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
stor@@ m@@ ingly celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bles himself and de@@ votes his hands to Merkel @-@ smoking .
great appl@@ ause is available for the Fest@@ spiel@@ orchester , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in extended leisure time .
the show was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to leave a more un@@ brid@@ led pipe concert , five years later , in which the occasional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls were interrupted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one not@@ ices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but also an understanding of his view .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
crowd : usually in Stein@@ furt at the furniture store , once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school on an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
crowd : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide range I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , so a bel@@ ated volunteer .
how does that come from ?
quantity : I have done Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I knew for myself that it was wrong for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it so ?
lot : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during winter semester .
I will study dual study , probably do a social worker training in Jugen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
it is possible to do it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ no@@ ons .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee is taken out of the family - one must always respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and they did not have reservations ?
a lot : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cut the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut down its divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction in job cuts , General Manager John Fall@@ on , which is predominantly announced at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 places have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to reduce cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .

con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter had been viol@@ ated , shared an explanation of N@@ ato .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by N@@ ato , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deleg@@ ated explo@@ sives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban away from power in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering raising the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that in the last few weeks , the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to cur@@ b smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EP@@ O leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone rules - in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in part of the country in order to establish where incis@@ ions must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , should boost economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spar@@ ked the impact of democr@@ ats and nature conserv@@ atives , which worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website states that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce pul@@ mon@@ ary function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as as@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants community space
in the end the decision was clear : in case of two contra@@ sts , the municipal council of flu@@ ori@@ de @-@ roots decides the establishment of a communal space in the future senior residence .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining part of the property was signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take place until now the church is owned by the church , there is no planning obstacle to the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council pret@@ end to have such a common room not as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the elderly @-@ just living , but openly in the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the decision made by the provision of funds for the current household already last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the area of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a community space would be , so T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent are eligible for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not willing to throw a b@@ ump between the legs , finding that both se@@ at@@ - and what is le@@ aned to the environment - as well as the ceiling roof - which reduces the drop @-@ down height and making the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer believes that this addi@@ tive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the board .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many own buildings that you don &apos;t want to get along so much , but now you rest in the common room out of the window , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very difficult to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger absolutely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface one does not give a subsi@@ dy , but get a real equivalent in doubt , in the case of doubt , the counter @-@ speech is .
Sta@@ iger &apos;s request to submit the proposal accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two oppos@@ ites at the original program that Stefan H@@ aller thus summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we grasp the decision , we make a giant step away to complete a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
colli@@ sion with car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was caught by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and seriously injured .
as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed , the 82 @-@ year Langen@@ felder was on his bike on the bicycle track of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg in direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Langen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the correspondence .
he met a car that was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ gn@@ ant .
FC Bayern München must reno@@ un@@ ce David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with human resources , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first time in the new season .
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , staff members at the German So@@ ccer World Record Champion of Bavaria Munich are getting bigger and bigger .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ab@@ stain from David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
that confirmed the Italian on Friday .
the Mün@@ ch@@ nern Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the last six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti was responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intensive game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out at 8@@ 1,@@ 360 people , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin of star to star hike
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall be formed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ war@@ te Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet of planets in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information many Har@@ z@@ besu@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he li@@ stens to nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
members want to set up pla@@ ques along the planned route and inform about stars and star images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ es good achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry kä@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Si@@ eber .
the information on the tables is to be supple@@ mented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting the location .
accessibility is also a crit@@ erion .
later the star path is to be extended by train .
&quot; the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts on the star@@ base path , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star rec@@ essed more light than another , although it was far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conserv@@ ation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ m@@ eda Galaxy with naked eye are clearly visible .
since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail since 2003 .
starting before Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail with its stel@@ ae leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ ter@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ ards ( municipality ) with the Sed@@ na planet .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the P@@ lu@@ to D@@ warf Plan@@ ets at the end point - are positioned exactly at a distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , measuring 70 centimet@@ ers away .
the entire distance of the planetary path is approximately four kilometers .
while the light is needed from Sun to P@@ lu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fix@@ ture , however , would take half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a colli@@ sion course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing organization Super Feder@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
Gar@@ cia put out the right hand and said : &quot; how are you , Champion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climb@@ ed up for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight @-@ ler &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is the demand for the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko vo@@ iced .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to schedule a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he said to Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous milit@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday fighting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the Three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight which must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sts
in the event of an accident on the A7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the end of the market .
the car dropped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ came and then lying on the roof in the green belt .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed towards the north for about an hour , afterwards the traffic on the left road was passed by the accident site .

after 2 : 2 Andre Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zes the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first race of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , even if not the two opponents had been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two ad@@ vers@@ aries too much , and we must watch better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the three @-@ whe@@ eled chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free push the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to capture it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one stands on the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better in preparation with the three @-@ leg@@ ged chain than with the four @-@ whe@@ eled chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ elmann who can build well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , but that we are still more harmon@@ ised and we don &apos;t have so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether you can talk about a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can get four points on Sunday and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of that his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I judge only after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to cancel earlier due to an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believed that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they could have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland will go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can swe@@ ep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach .
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application review published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for the medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency judged that the person &quot; was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results have been ongoing during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the person examined 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I images are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute whose work encomp@@ asses the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they were sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say that we should not do that as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ correctly ass@@ essing is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg progres@@ ses well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road and Traffic in the Regier@@ ung@@ sprä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began at the same time on all three renov@@ ations in need between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly moderni@@ zed .
the two other bridges guide the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge @-@ cap .
this is an edge attachment , which is also used as an operating path .
at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.20 m wide bridge @-@ cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path should be lost .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling requires the laying of cables through the Bau@@ werk in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building and the scrap@@ er in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg traffic is regulated by traffic lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully locked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridge adjustments is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est with German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato Sal@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not so common that parties come to an end , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , what else is hard to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the day of the volcanic Eifel ( C@@ DU , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flags on this day because the Af@@ D invites to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle in R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to Af@@ D , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city pick@@ nick was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking underneath the R@@ ond@@ ola - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ deutscher potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the Af@@ D could eat easily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported about the Af@@ D volcano Eifel , he tried to do such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built @-@ up Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is done : at 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhine @-@ Greenland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ woman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the chief candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their spe@@ eches .
the police presence remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ age have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can cancel - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets Tr@@ ump@@ et
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher posit@@ ae Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the row Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konzer@@ te morgen , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan fol@@ klore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European top @-@ class orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo concert of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach will sound like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play become an intri@@ gu@@ ing overall art work .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs becomes consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is very open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately was bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette ac@@ tress insur@@ es opposite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I had dat@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten said that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived du@@ alism and believed in it seriously .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them they suffered , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school times when they prefer like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a bush .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , they don &apos;t like to educ@@ ate their love life : &quot; people expect you to respond in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal @-@ shop from his father .
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said , &quot; The change of party by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country magnificent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russia &apos;s Athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ el said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were str@@ apped out of gold and silver medals at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; IA@@ AF President Co@@ e said to the re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole council and the whole congress were delighted by the Russian Federation that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the Athle@@ tics World Championships that begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actor .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohi@@ bit@@ ing trainers are still free , he told re@@ por@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
mour@@ ning for Mali St@@ acked soldiers
during a fun@@ eral ceremony in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers had been killed in a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
to the still un@@ explained stub@@ born cause , Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( C@@ DU ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she called the two inver@@ ted pilots but as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ön@@ ner of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice given by them in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief of staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen have died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( C@@ DU ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ eker .
ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood by arm in arm to the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense from the Ley@@ en described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and shar@@ pen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann had built up the aviation operation of the helicop@@ ter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali didn &apos;t show Ley@@ en : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
he shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with the decision of her husband , she was called on to continue in the communication .
where Prinz Hen@@ rik is buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also tables the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House , explained .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will finally be , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later wife , prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign at the Dan@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk st@@ umps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the call to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
C@@ DU and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , however , is not willing to res@@ ign , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the Parliament spoke out for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties from their Sunday fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight single @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 Ele@@ ction in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the C@@ DU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
C@@ DU @-@ Fra@@ ktion@@ sch@@ ef Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record them .
thus C@@ DU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new parliament will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it imper@@ ative that the parliament decides as soon as possible his self @-@ resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ DU Group is expected to decide on its next action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the governor with@@ draws confidence and choos@@ es a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be audi@@ ted legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally insp@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the west@@ ward step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called himself a tra@@ ilers of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens demanded the dep@@ u@@ ties to return their land convention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we assume that she has received her land convention , which she received on the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Green Party , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen tremend@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to speak any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substantial differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens of Saxony to the C@@ DU as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social @-@ Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country day .
the exit T@@ aun@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her pen@@ ultimate van@@ ity and in her fru@@ stration , the political scientist set out her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hubertus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the C@@ DU brings this dirty trick in Lower Saxony and tries to hit from it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens C@@ DU @-@ Fra@@ ktion@@ sch@@ ef Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the C@@ DU .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country election with personal career .
at that time , the C@@ DU was the strongest force , SPD and Green in the day before the SPD , but had a very thin majority of one voice in the parliament day .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed tei@@ zers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal have happened ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ n@@ aissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food Monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s suffer@@ ings .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just as the manufacturers ensure that the sold @-@ out products are market@@ able and harm@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the back @-@ level content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies are to blame .
do manufacturing companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art knowledge , the production plants do not meet immediate gu@@ ilt .
rather , they must reck@@ on on the basis of pres@@ umed illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always , there are too few controllers in the appointment .
is it only lacking in the personnel or in the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can lie , are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already pointed out several times that I expect a complete clari@@ fication by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and market@@ able foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed .
through the pan@@ elled means manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are advised to have a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it has to be worked on all levels consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be clari@@ fied quickly and completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play Rules , which have been launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PSG must point at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PSG can certainly make the money easy@@ going to sign Ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power rich by the power of Qatar .
players are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but with legitimate income sources , they will have to give them the break @-@ even point in their work @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had enormous debts in their quest for success would effectively dec@@ eive and risk to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which originally used Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen by the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor , Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will step up the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has hit the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PSG earned a fine of 60 million Euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million Euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to super@@ impose their financial supervision by raising their income through companies connected with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ an enterprise could sponsor the PSG , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market value , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PSG payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar via payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be and such a man@@ eu@@ ver could easily find out for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ad@@ here to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PSG about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .
the latest reports show that , in 2015 / 16 , a revenue of € 54@@ 2.4 million has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
PSG expected that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ sales .
the association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish le@@ ague was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PSG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financi@@ er Fair@@ play because one has different ways or may have different interests when a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ gia supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white ch@@ og@@ g@@ ite panels of 14 grams per year distribute the flight att@@ endants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information on the costs .
in the field of industry insi@@ ders , the volume of orders according to &quot; Nord@@ west Switzerland &quot; amounted to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achiev@@ es annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate producer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many applicants there is at the new tender does not want to betra@@ y Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to rene@@ w the Treaty on the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not att@@ ain@@ able for an opinion .
chocolate panels spread Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Bar@@ ry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long hau@@ l flights , the First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ aya passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes also on the short stretch , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia geht in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; und &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this re@@ petition of the story is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter turned the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking up at the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play tight children who grow up - nevertheless they made the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the final part of the W@@ itz@@ ky .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emoti@@ onally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more according to the found@@ ational principle , including a reef on the stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ th years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that the cra@@ dle looks &quot; ) .
at one point a character sho@@ ots through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ b@@ ign@@ ant plot involved in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good idea by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt Dill@@ ons Unter@@ i@@ pp@@ enb@@ art from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old cr@@ acker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the moments of random mad@@ ness that might inc@@ ense this fran@@ chise like a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seven Up ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now remin@@ is@@ cent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West Ring@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka as a director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ o J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ gen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to see ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , how Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent match &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but Com@@ rade Det@@ ective is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan M@@ ask - that it often plays like a single one .
in six long epis@@ odes it is gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited down to a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Rum@@ anian creator was not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
ban on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police took a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 def@@ endants were arrested at the age of 25 years and 77 years and ordered arrest warran@@ ts against them .
the officials also secured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the promotion .
a total of 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia will be accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organized drug traff@@ icking in Southern Germany since the summer of 2016 .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had virtually daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the great use was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a pub early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
ways lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the register of foreigners .
short@@ com@@ ings of registered data could lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis that is in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) .
in the register , there are estimated ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by some 600 foreig@@ ner authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been properly maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer need to appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data input can slow back processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of paid people there are EU citizens who don &apos;t have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false orders led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paid @-@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; meaning it is in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has apparently begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerg@@ es from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Osn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it says that BA@@ MF brings such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper published reference to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin deal , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant returns to another EU country , this state can send him back to the enc@@ ro@@ achment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and housing of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal political spokes@@ person on the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten to thre@@ aten human rights un@@ lawful conditions and a threat to child &apos;s welfare due to lack in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach have already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens that were awarded on Friday .
all the foremost Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shared with his now 100 donations now 50 liters of blood .
traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Municipal Council ackno@@ wle@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is created for it , and we will give respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to stran@@ gers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the District Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn tra@@ ilers reported of the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , with 114 don@@ ors , we achieved the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer counted on the multi @-@ discipline and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter donated ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their li@@ veli@@ hood .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lug@@ g@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Fund ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25 % , whereby fewer members stro@@ ve to increase this month as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alised that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation that was heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs would likely rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic package that was issued one year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks starting next February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice because the pressure on the real income of households continued to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank emphas@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ ments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 USD and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .
the decision to not change after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months rose to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low levels of salary as the shar@@ pen@@ ing gets worse first before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the in@@ comes from in@@ comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will recover considerably at the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the sound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will reach the prices and the economy completely .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.@@ 6 % in June , although the bank said this was expected and will res@@ ume it in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of recent s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are lou@@ dly looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages shut down , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in N@@ HS from September after a fight against the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ posi@@ tional phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) recorded before the sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study for more than 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a verdi@@ ct by the Supreme Court of Justice last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS United Kingdom Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described it as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious diseases .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means having just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who come into question for treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners , who were not treated successfully .
appropriate participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in to participate in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of medications this week after an international competitive purchasing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as well as targeted , targeted and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of modi@@ fying the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded effort in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negoti@@ ation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that they will contribute to the completion of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , fell in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel mill is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled the fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Ligh@@ ting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , mir@@ r@@ oring is like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable cu@@ es are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and thus help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electric so@@ ckets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard in something entirely amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ n@@ asty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate Imperial Victoria &apos;s worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and designer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place at the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers owns 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been described in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a judi@@ ci@@ ary means that Col@@ in &apos;s property worth $ 316 million and $ 176 million in the value of $ 176 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - Col@@ in , how Paul affir@@ ms him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both sides .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ acies from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans @-@ shop of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says he began West@@ co when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much although he was a former AF@@ L board member and following a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media took in contact with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw up our family name through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sl@@ umps of new head of staff are planning to restrict the pres@@ idents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , it will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the White House &apos;s new head of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more ev@@ oc@@ ative course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new head of staff of the White House , met with leading employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that was thrown into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information . &quot;
Kelly &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet .
President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relationship with television extends decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; when Kan@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places that were persu@@ aded , &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control according to six ex @-@ election officials is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign owners know something that we don &apos;t know about others - that Tr@@ ump@@ ets would have contained more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees have done it several times to keep trouble from him , their efforts have paid off .
but no one has consistently avoided the fact that Tr@@ ump is causing contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may prop@@ el their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the predi@@ le@@ ction of the advis@@ ors to lead the president for strategic reasons dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example described by re@@ por@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what happened at the end of February , when somebody accused the President of a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source of being a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and vo@@ iced her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; attempted to implement a system to manage and document paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe disp@@ at@@ ched in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after crimin@@ als are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and wor@@ shipped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences showed that many fu@@ gi@@ tives hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the ww@@ w@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted website has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of online requests could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travellers on war@@ feet , which have negoti@@ ated a dit@@ ch drawn by the municipality to claim a field from their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road called Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch that had been excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their inci@@ dents .
the tak@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense facilities and sque@@ e@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry people urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced through shame to implement , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live along Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my common tax if the Council cannot even stop this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant who did not want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible have an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of Birk@@ enhof becomes forest @-@ hotel Luise
the Wald@@ hotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
due to the closure of the Birk@@ enhof Hotel through the then ambience Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rat@@ samt as a gathering accommodation , which ensured controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt , mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , def@@ ended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Luise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Luise and now Wald@@ hotel Luise .
in the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were pulled out , blank@@ ets partially disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is transformed , new windows are built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewelry piece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a up@@ scale downtown level , sh@@ ear@@ er empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread widely , Sch@@ erer continues to explain .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ vers .
the performances of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly .
just under one million Euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outdoor installations are also placed on the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : U.S. Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair , US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee in recent weeks accepted the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on the matter entrusted to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper adverti@@ sed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the transmitter CN@@ N reported that there were already initial charges of the ab@@ om@@ ination associated with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian attor@@ ney .
U.S. secret services have accused the Krem@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump@@ et campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand , who acted in campaign as a consultant to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also recorded more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that Tr@@ ump has personally brought Tr@@ ump into the centre and investigate whether the President could possibly ob@@ struct the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether it should be charged .
accordingly , Grand Jury are also called the Indi@@ ctment .
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the board can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to pre @-@ download persons under o@@ ath .
according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian attor@@ ney .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former Elec@@ tor Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were at the meeting .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the implementation shows that Mu@@ eller does not shy away in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act fast .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the implementation of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for anxiety for President Tr@@ ump .
amid the new revel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the democr@@ ats a possibility to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he did not know about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but this usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sonder@@ gene@@ alog@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the President .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed because of this , it was in the statement further .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this re@@ pro@@ ach , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become no@@ isy ; they want to ob@@ struct the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey told a Senate Committee in June , Tr@@ ump has asked him about a set of investigations against the former National Security Ad@@ vis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special promot@@ er and its employees .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later @-@ back President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on the pres@@ idency of the president of the Justice Department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators introduced legislative proposals on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismis@@ sed as easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant Eis@@ berg in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the west ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ice @-@ mountain has been solved by the scar@@ ce size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research shared this on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which is heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , now travel north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest king@@ doms that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear according to research figures .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ et background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e the balance of w@@ axes and v@@ om@@ iting was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
A@@ WI @-@ Res@@ ear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete shot @-@ file .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn so far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under sus@@ pen@@ se and can crum@@ ble if a piece is broken down in a key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and displ@@ ace the ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice sheet causes the gl@@ aci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only very low , the British research project for observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .

&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sing , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers did not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has collap@@ sed in recent decades .
this long skirt of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the Arctic ice area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decline in temperature increased .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has been heated by about three degrees in the past 50 years and en@@ um@@ er@@ ates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
C@@ DU wants to have Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy a vac@@ ant position , the C@@ DU ur@@ ges to res@@ ign from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the district &apos;s day 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first day of work behind them .
the teachers at the circle are apparently very popular .
around 620 applications were to be seen in vain for this year .
nonetheless , the circle still l@@ acks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the C@@ DU wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG in the C@@ ret@@ an &apos;s Day and to oppose the short@@ age of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration will work out a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers but to counter@@ act forward @-@ looking applications .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ new@@ com@@ ers and include an education offensive , demand C@@ DU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition among the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees , which ex@@ crete disease or age @-@ related reasons .
thus , the highest possible time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , leader of the C@@ DU , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he was already sponsor@@ ing a f@@ ist surprise in the day of the circle when he publicly ques@@ tioned the cost of personnel and stun@@ ned the rest of the parties .
people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which enable an exit from the local employers &quot; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satis@@ factory solution at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a house @-@ rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the C@@ DU tries to pay the employees and officials better than the public service charges .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly dict@@ ated , increases or more money only exist when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be established in which employees are concerned about the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
last but not least because of the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the sound of NGO migrants
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German relief organization &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew had worked together effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organization , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express detailed alle@@ g@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only evaluate all alle@@ g@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had super@@ vised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew takes aboard ding@@ h@@ y migrants who are delivered directly from human traff@@ ick@@ ers and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such encounter occurred allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Act , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to sit down on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must mainly have an Italian police officer , who super@@ vis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Do@@ ctors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
meanwhile , Minn@@ iti insi@@ sted that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharp@@ ly in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and the cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine white bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin outdoor posting &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Northern Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ desheim .
there followed observation points , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream planes .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were p@@ opp@@ y .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ ages market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , v@@ antage point reached the look@@ out , connected with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed into the open air inhal@@ atorium cur@@ ative Sole .

after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters of altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga gears up for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer con@@ soles , instead of being swe@@ at@@ y in wind and weather across the stadium race ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga ca@@ ver@@ ns who are increasingly involved in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pro@@ s for the game of computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That on this move several associations will rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this weekend , FIFA World Cup in London will organise the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven quali@@ fies .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal particularly with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people will still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the attempts to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets more often than only once a year to send the German Bundes@@ liga to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA @-@ simulation FIFA are challenged at a competitive level .
long ago , like in normal sports , li@@ fest@@ y@@ les have become established , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport altogether ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used .
Ingo FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ och@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also train their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sports were missing .
in a positive way , the scientist stands out for the highly integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ sport .
the players are internationally on the road , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive amus@@ ement software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
sales will be at 130 million in three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is little to deal with the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte coun@@ sel@@ ors are writing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ acker Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot is happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian School , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a classroom , says FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE .
in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ eine , according to D@@ utt , is now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board of R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to fall in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t cling to the fact that only football will remain as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy is pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were subjected to prob@@ ation .
Carter was con@@ vic@@ ted in June for a negli@@ gent murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ break@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have changed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance she totally regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not have the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how to deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the knowledge that she would never be participating in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person I have been working with since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a judicial preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to request another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang down , spring out of a building , eche you yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you must do is switch off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Carter &apos;s attention sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who def@@ ended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2007 for murder at her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a commentary in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter is deser@@ ving sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern we@@ ars a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - Extra motivation does not harm .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua felt immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm , and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made his ha@@ ste to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entrance could have been better than at 0 : 2 vs SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also show Kim@@ i like that .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f est@@ anci@@ er , who had been chosen from youth players , de@@ but@@ ors and just out of the holiday , but he .
most of the time , sugar is distributed to those who wish to che@@ w a lot , which you want to keep in a mood .
those who were destined to take the heir of L@@ ame can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take over responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashed across the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
to the right , this is now his position , the white bond on the arm did its rest .
and at all Kim@@ i appeared in this start@@ ling such as the one who can also take the helm .
he gave orders , tried to direct the un@@ broken tro@@ upe .
he had the sight of the whole while many others were occupied with themselves .
V@@ idal therefore , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( collap@@ sed barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out on the performance of the Asia trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in Bavaria Tri@@ ko@@ t don &apos;t have a negative impact .
after all , it worked quite well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times successfully in the play @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also brought up for this style &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how unusual this Bavaria world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new te@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard about Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Grü@@ ne ) nor Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time ad@@ here to the old Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer enterprises ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing interfer@@ es with the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn @-@ off sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is set to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ er@@ wal@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Bundes@@ verkehr@@ swe@@ ge@@ plan .
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Minister Cornelia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive enterprises .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people wanting to start their own company , the I@@ HK comm@@ its .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed championship test and 2500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of the Master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road@@ works are quickly facts to create , but at the same time there is no need for the country in the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , managing director of the I@@ HK Trier .
from 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in state @-@ owned mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied so far .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
C@@ DU @-@ FRA@@ K@@ TION@@ S@@ VI@@ CE Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the invo@@ ices , the country invested more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us is expecting a concept of the country as it wants to resolve the short@@ age of skilled labour in the region .
in addition , the previous broad@@ band construction in the country is in@@ timi@@ dating .
in 2016 , regional companies evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stub@@ born internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still in the super@@ visory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of dis@@ agreements she had already cleared the field .
Audi should change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer the software to update more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a call@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European car manufacturers have greatly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma .
to install the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles , also assume what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of gu@@ essing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others will be examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavy burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to Volkswagen &apos;s profit . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was temporarily one of the most published carto@@ on illustr@@ ators , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still alive and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he was among others a drawer for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures revol@@ ve in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own figures , he is still at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
through cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches , his cute figures continue to find a lot of dis@@ sem@@ ination worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand @-@ foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to come to the cinema ob@@ jection in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s wei@@ rd for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he tends to rely more on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced without a word .
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought and due to diseases that transmit insects , leading scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , big head@@ aches prepared .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert at the CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in the spring brought much less rain and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small z@@ ic@@ ad , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that carries the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lav@@ ender oil does not only attract tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and ev@@ ap@@ oration of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to d@@ rought .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly magazine Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children to the office who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perception and gut feelings reach .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to commen@@ ced his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts , showing his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 , in order to process the cases of journalists , it initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug traff@@ icking and organized crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are not comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we susp@@ end all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he was only able to ride a few blocks until his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as riv@@ alising fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street each day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings who are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke away with gu@@ ilt because he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Dam@@ ian , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , pres@@ umed ais@@ le members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to new@@ s@@ boxes .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country to its own security after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper publishing the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined forces with five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 U.S. dollars into shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate Journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the po@@ ison of drugs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper comp@@ eted a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .
re@@ por@@ ters loved it to be able to publish hard work without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else had to deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , it received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he voluntarily gave up that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug Trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you see as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the little bird , who was able to cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ yard , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and sit there always at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own beliefs about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells false , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with J@@ avier happens . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an area .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters ques@@ tioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen owned by the governor themselves as not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has cur@@ red three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures that focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ por@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this area , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier , the readers had viewed Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez took a couple of signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for a further journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by having written &quot; SOS Press &quot; in organized protests and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists , because they told the truth .
she has since asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , participating government officials and a society of equality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blank@@ et with organised crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the media watch@@ dog group &quot; artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by Z@@ eta @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Laredo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ el with an editorial on the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traff@@ icking sho@@ ots him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already over , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ mon .
a number of shooting houses with her@@ ri@@ val ri@@ val and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the on@@ board edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
sir@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez looked at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were willing .
if they were frigh@@ tened at all , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mining worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even see that its fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said it had had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dose @-@ carrier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ an Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has aston@@ ished researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something out of the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy Earth @-@ cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you smile only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant @-@ e@@ ater although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a wall @-@ changing tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ eit , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to get better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts predi@@ ct that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli named after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dose @-@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on po@@ inters about his life , including his counter@@ part Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and pushed into the sea where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland as they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pound ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ aters were sw@@ ung by western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste repeat@@ ed@@ ely covering hol@@ ky arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a winning in Lot@@ to &apos; .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ tery .
there are numerous injured , miles @-@ long jams - and g@@ aff .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured during the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first indications of the police we were between the junction of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks .
the exact number of injured was initially no indication .
it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large bu@@ oy@@ ancy of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in Munich &apos;s driving direction , an approximately ten @-@ kilomet@@ re long back @-@ back was formed .
as reported an AZ Repor@@ ter , there was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - due to numerous g@@ aff .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ated the hall@@ marks of the vehicle makers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger .
a helicop@@ ter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing escap@@ es in the train and sle@@ eps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ gen@@ ious thought .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an uns@@ an@@ ft or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
travel card control .
but the periods of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn ( Deutsche Bahn ) is currently testing the complete travel card control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail@@ road speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the lane validation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and one must have booked an online ticket - what already the most passengers do anyway .
you also have to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works in such a way : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the test customers then a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation appears .
the trains get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the seat Y booked .
when the train companion arrives at number Y in the ticket control role , he knows that there is a passenger with a already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train companion , checked in the DB Navigator by yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions belong to the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents necessary for de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to demonstrate .
the result is endless discussions between the driver and the passenger , which leads to bad mood in the section or greater room and delays in the control of your own tickets and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ os@@ ly Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ eted on their tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ et the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s le@@ mon@@ ed body that was stretched on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she turned her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people who sh@@ ou@@ ted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman escaped his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell has remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have become ac@@ custom@@ ed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and res@@ ili@@ ence that exists from the viewpoint of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell , with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which they had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any disgu@@ sting rac@@ ism , she is not unlike the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would have a bad service to keep them off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a territory when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after August 9 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ eram@@ an Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around Death Road in@@ mates .
his involvement brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell , together with six other locals followed the White Stre@@ ets team ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for this is how I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ando &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ando &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ando &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have overall carried the movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , although it was at the foref@@ ront because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news agency in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the r@@ acial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that it calls its home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
it &apos;s hard to leave the topic cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Sch@@ olz ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is standing , in which 13 direct markets offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work , the end will end .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Keller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have been buying almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country fr@@ auen again and again very gladly .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s ei for us .
we would like to wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is that too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can settle in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why buy a shopping box in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market there , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , store stores are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left will then van@@ ish . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a Mark@@ thalle will not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall pass during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit Gallery already manage to sell all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply will not work .
and a shopping centre that stands empty does not need anyone .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ s DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which resem@@ ble almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly resem@@ ble cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ incis@@ ions , who were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st became a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after being secre@@ tly classified as secret diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called a Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ lady and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted from p@@ anning and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look a sharp , though some intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
M@@ anning who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but openly talking about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white self @-@ ie , in which M@@ anning deliberately sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wi@@ wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts such as cigar@@ ette sleeves and che@@ wing g@@ um , by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she couldn &apos;t visit at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprison@@ ed m@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ ber@@ ies , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic called &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Image , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ei Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ epa would turn judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand was a welcome type of happy encounter .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to infl@@ ame the rigid spl@@ its he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all of these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning with its superior signature among them ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their sur@@ name is marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people hopefully will take with them is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ work of 2007 , Sp@@ icy Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned carto@@ on novel .
it shows M@@ anning how it emerg@@ es from the disciplinary arc@@ tic of the United States like King Kong with a free @-@ talk ef@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they keep your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed by the mas@@ ks in the middle of the room , from its own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ers , which assemble themselves like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also focused on how everything was in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ s stat@@ ure ) , in which her genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ op@@ es were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea as the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University because of murder
a nation@@ wide hunting game is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been killed in a luxurious Chicago home with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court of Justice show .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a community warning system , published by the Chicago Police Department , states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the scene of the event , and Det@@ ective investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , Vice @-@ President of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them had now been judged and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair that is being investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help US investig@@ ators in every imagin@@ able way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chief Police of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he urged the susp@@ ects to susp@@ end the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the Building Administr@@ ators of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip , compl@@ ained that something had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will finish the W@@ ADA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ ADA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ ADA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the replacement of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ADA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list however states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the W@@ ADA under the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conduct the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has committed an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disp@@ uted positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rus@@ ada was excluded from the conduct of dop@@ ing control in Russia in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July , W@@ ADA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that Rus@@ ada moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
Amy A@@ ret@@ t wanted to best measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
the answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called for help from the outside .
a new race of Human Resources start @-@ ups is at w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , provide special groups and demo@@ graphic groups to address employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers manage to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite leaders and contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up Gl@@ int , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124;
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low cons@@ ents results - so you can drill out why .
companies come to see that they must remain at the foref@@ ront of workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former colleague describes a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like Gl@@ int , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Industry could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the U@@ ber F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like Gl@@ int , Con@@ ver@@ cent can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behaviour .
and if the principal business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that its employees are badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , worker fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,@@ 000 employees and over 500 sites , has employed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company employs Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or an un@@ fair tra@@ ine@@ eship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to re@@ ap ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Gl@@ int and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
it received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more obliged to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Con@@ ver@@ cent and Gl@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors are reaching Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analy@@ tics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem about Gl@@ int is reported , so saved .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company has always received new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .

for a good part of the team , these idle minutes dar a lunch break .
players registered to the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Centre next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as &apos;s six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
20 years before the start of formal game preparations for her pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the N@@ CA@@ A rules , even if they added another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continue to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is given in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Fun@@ ke Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been filled with foot@@ balls , which will have a protective network behind a pe@@ at pole , no easy task will be .
bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our safety , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against fake news &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send it to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fac@@ tual test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French vot@@ ers being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful mail@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate declaration in English that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts @-@ review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to the recognition of which stories of fac@@ tual re@@ viewers are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at someone &apos;s hand@@ writing that has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also present .
ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) it all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted Hy@@ än@@ enk@@ opf on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ aping , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at night and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years when Arist@@ o@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Empire , cards depic@@ ting who possessed something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ver@@ mic@@ elli Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ rol that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell was portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the guys seemed to be quite odd , getting debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has made a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the conce@@ al@@ ment of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan confidential until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a party at Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday on the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount and cost the campaign .
military For@@ ms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s Fe@@ ar of the Army
every year at the beginning of August the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on pen@@ alties and promotions in the officer &apos;s cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as in former times , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government , the five vice @-@ ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consult@@ ations .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population .
the government draws the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dismis@@ sed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a wi@@ re@@ ff of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the coup attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan was really in control of the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the tu@@ b@@ bing ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at any rate , the big cleaning of the army and the security forces goes on .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan sum@@ mon@@ ed another 73@@ 95 public servers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly considered the actual masters of the country .
three times they praised their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan stri@@ ves specifically an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly so @-@ called officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that happens , such a development could not leave N@@ ato cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the involvement of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges .
the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he fores@@ ees to cut the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by issu@@ ing the way citizens from other countries are given Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minist@@ ery wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race @-@ level shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months , the future of the race ticket has been disp@@ uted - now it should go very quickly .
before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the mar@@ vel@@ ous route , on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the race increase in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g track , the country is particularly important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , state Secretary of Transport , on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs about 2.5 million euros for the repair of the route .
of this sum , the country exceeds 75 percent .
the contract , on which basis the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thur@@ ing@@ ian Rail@@ ways as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race @-@ ste@@ amer should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway link between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the past few months it has been tested in the course of a pilot business , whether the route is used by enough many people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ ump@@ tu@@ ous .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought it could not be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .
yes indeed .
sex robots are at the moment a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key on the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt his robot according to his beliefs &quot; and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturb@@ ing as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre@@ programmed characters such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , which im@@ parts the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired of conversation , or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturb@@ ing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s said on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to a bit dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore .
most men will naturally not hold sex robots , and while FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ising women sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; Der Report der Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the intri@@ cate body and the out@@ cast eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate from their companion or simply go away .
they do not have medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid girls
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a certainty of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US vot@@ ers , also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump &apos;s sel@@ ections .
we are all suppos@@ edly supposed to let our filter bub@@ bles burst .
less noticed is the power to bring up tr@@ umps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a le@@ op@@ ed poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is important to me that this also involves considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dism@@ iss@@ al effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we refer to the sc@@ ary possibility that our cookies will no longer be abor@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself today of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ kom@@ ische version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked out ) - both in fact seem to be a very mild crime .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify himself as im@@ meas@@ urable enhancement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals rot@@ ate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ mat@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience since two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ th years can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score but luck@@ ily no one asked him afterwards .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same as the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to slo@@ wing what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I &apos;m tired of having the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
due to murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ turn@@ al in@@ truder that hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to apply this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too transparent .
the National Prosec@@ utor said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers from F@@ ützen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students in the future go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , she welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in Hüh@@ ner@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his ch@@ ick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , and the eag@@ les spread his wings on a high mountain and escaped .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the dogs d@@ anced with the young sho@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder wore to the bet .
the eagle stood for the integration , said the leader Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonging to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ t@@ eller that he feels accepted in his new school .
thank@@ s@@ words were given to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always j@@ umps back to teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the time of the kitchen is over , the teacher Sophia Schumacher said .
she divor@@ ced her students only after two years of instruction because it was a really great time .
finally , they have been able to rely on the four @-@ t@@ aps .
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
in this occasion , great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ tail@@ ors have already registered for the new school year .
arrested two Bulg@@ arians because of illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprison@@ ed for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people were arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have intensi@@ fied the control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place which is not intended for this purpose , substantial money pen@@ alties .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates that are tra@@ ded are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the power @-@ travel Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the next few months , but still no exact date .
Daimler has informed every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its framework .
how long should the change@@ over@@ s take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the attach@@ ments depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntary the car manufacturers do not act on the topic of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
pres@@ um@@ ably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
now threat@@ ens a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
in rural areas , there has so far been no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first R@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution on Thursday announced , this year also includes singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) to the scholars .
awards will be awarded at the beginning of December .
traditionally US president Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the lau@@ re@@ ate Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series announced already to reno@@ un@@ ce its participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - and even depri@@ ve them of the means - and it bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tr@@ ump to make her view clear .
the Kennedy @-@ Centre , named after the former President , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former lau@@ re@@ ates include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the position is already written - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a Mayor for 31 years .
and the work still makes him a lot of fun , as he gives in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports from varied but also challenging tasks that await his successor .
at the same time , he wonders that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .
the town is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time .
this is the case - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision .
as Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a Lower building rights authority , the applicant must inform corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill it , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but proximity to the city is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good company climate and a good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years , some important projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diversi@@ fied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz is about to be initiated .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium refur@@ bish@@ ment is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we make it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work here is fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design is available for a master builder of large games room .
Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener could be re@@ acted to many quite flexi@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often cited by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye for what is cle@@ ans@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going town master empha@@ sizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is responsible for high responsibility any@@ how .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here about my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of co @-@ ordination and co @-@ ordination : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been part of Manfred Scho@@ er ( civil engineering ) for the past ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city .
anyone wanting to bury Roland W@@ acker should have a completed study as a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture according to information from the city of Has@@ lach and have good knowledge in the areas of building and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt inter@@ rup@@ ts high and civil engineering , construction guidelines , under@@ carriage facilities , administration of urban properties , urban farm with the Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ är@@ t@@ ner@@ ei as well as Lower building rights authority , including monuments protection .
bike on lines thrown : southern ground @-@ track locked
according to the police , the hi@@ ther@@ to unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night .
close to the Tat@@ ort , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike rider were witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a stroke of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rat@@ ors or the perpet@@ rat@@ ors would have brought themselves to great danger and also endangered the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the installation , as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail transport , the potential of the rail customers could also come to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south@@ way track could be led without disabilities .
nearly ten people went out on Friday mor@@ nings , two of them dealt with correspondence .
freight trains did not fall off , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 meters of overhead cables had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an contributes to proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the guiding researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ate more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel disease , if the same system also applies to people .
the post@@ do@@ ktor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an investigated a kind of immune cell that stimul@@ ated tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was accommod@@ ated separately , this did not have .
it pres@@ umed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they l@@ acked an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria work on the immune system , the researchers allowed L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known if tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed an &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound sign of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira first mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u took off at the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho form@@ alized his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this week the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed three more new commitments but he insi@@ sted that the club did a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved to the shape of a Dream@@ liner across the US , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had already made such advertisement earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is rotating : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked forward to Berlin with a certain concern .
only no rup@@ t@@ cy from the party headquarters , but no contrary wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the elec@@ toral vict@@ ors .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus closely observe events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als .
what Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were grav@@ estones .
and one by one .
after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal @-@ C@@ DU sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again demonstrates : red green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said C@@ DU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of Euro MPs led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party managing director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ westen to give her mandate back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transfer to the C@@ DU signi@@ fies a clear distor@@ tion of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and Elec@@ tor of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD suppor@@ ter sigh@@ s that the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday mor@@ nings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the res@@ ign@@ ation of the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to C@@ DU without own government majority .
it is the pro@@ visional highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD country associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery begins with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med down at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the case - and it became much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the swi@@ pe , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously r@@ apped in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just taken new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next aby@@ ss .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD governor , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning .
and because in crisis communication he did so pretty much wrong with what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
06.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Vampire Di@@ aries
because of the VW @-@ tail@@ stock and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in the critic@@ isms for quite some time .
vintage surveys were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l increasingly tried to set acc@@ ents in the Con@@ federation .
the endeav@@ our of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to give him a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time , Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal obligation of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens in essence no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz is not at all at all .
at times , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliament@@ ari@@ anism of the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen presents her own career star@@ ters about the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ westen was not elected to Parliament because of her person , but on the state list of the Angl@@ o @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dutch dep@@ uty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vot@@ ers @-@ willing four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who heads the Lower Saxon Social Democratic candidate into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future C@@ DU MP counter@@ fei@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or it has given further commitments of the C@@ DU Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ing funds for local people III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three STE@@ G Urban Development representatives gathered in sensi@@ tivities on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave again a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 it exists in sensitive san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the total funding .
in the re@@ organisation zone II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is important to also support the interior development , and not only to tap new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the Government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a restructuring area III .
the total funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality sensi@@ gen .
how does a rehabilitation area arise ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is even interest to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the area borders may then also be moved again .
the STE@@ G on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; Social city , &quot; in which the re@@ productions would then be carried out .
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the rehabilitation area would then eventually be defined as a set @-@ ordin@@ ance .
the approval period for the funding period has been running since January 1 , 2017 , until 30 April 2026 .
until September this year , however , the survey would only once again be carried out , in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionn@@ aire for filling out .
in November or December , it is expected to take place as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can start in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the said prepar@@ atory investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about evaluating and deciding the urban@@ istic ab@@ norm@@ alities and deciding when to be refurb@@ ished and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register .
once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to the sensi@@ bility and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
this is why questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Land Bo@@ w &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which it concerns the structural condition and renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Haushalts@@ - und Wohnungs@@ bogen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Operating Sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if the premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire is not at the same time a request for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler added that the distribution of funds to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; town@@ center II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the cost of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ er costs up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ter in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire @-@ brig@@ ade car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or fr@@ o , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the notes of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicop@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty nav@@ al commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived on July 17th at 7@@ am on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the plane .
the records provided by the TIME did not indicate whether a second flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was if it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy Command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but demanding their use only for a photo OR is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation when the presidential jet stood in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the vice @-@ president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted on the training needs of flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ter units also flew 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Sik@@ or@@ sky spokes@@ man said that the company was not involved in putting the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for 2017 , the Do@@ D rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of Un@@ ity list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an R@@ AND study from 2015 , the rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of helicop@@ ter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week of things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to emphasize this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his round about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House Tr@@ ump talked to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and sh@@ ou@@ ted with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
&quot; &quot; &quot; top riders of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga k@@ icks off at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ orn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel , at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ orn Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
despite after five games still fl@@ aw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis B@@ Bundes@@ liga got the sense of the reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the imports from the high North are mainly concerned for class and stability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their plans and fin@@ s can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , the Czech Liber@@ ec , plays an active role in the competition in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man ( Czech Republic ) for the first time in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski even at the AT@@ P @-@ Tour@@ nament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two vict@@ ories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ re from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when on Wednesday evening he set his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ dow the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Congress a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , since then , investors of the Austrian O@@ MV , co @-@ financed with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea E@@ ster@@ y North Stream 2 .
the threat of dr@@ ones is enormous .
nevertheless it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official Statement of the Oil Company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by an Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the Hit@@ series von Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar killer un@@ vei@@ ls , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first tra@@ ilers and showed the newest vill@@ ains of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed her attention to the rich@@ est organisation of the world drug traff@@ icking : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise &quot; with more state pun@@ ish@@ ments and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the guide of Kart@@ ells , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) warran@@ ts the Mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colum@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in urban nur@@ sery workshops , the clock is turned back .
on the 1st of September the city of K@@ ref@@ eld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ reg@@ iment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking continues to be cooked except for home : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked cooled .
the city operates 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the K@@ ref@@ eld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
in the past day , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week , in the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children remain at the age of 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants from 1 September have kitchen service : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them to salad , raw vegetables and fruit , to por@@ tioning the meal individually , give away food from , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups , as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides over the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more integrated and it is easier for k@@ ite management to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
pur@@ ging the K@@ ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it turned out in cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ arranged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for around 750 people in the area of education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , President of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be en@@ rolled in the provinces . three women en@@ code for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ ded with the transition from international mar@@ tial arts to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the next power by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million vot@@ ers .

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union would like to make a sense of the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow over the long @-@ term commitment to production at the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than $ 5 million in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company leader , CI@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ask a concern that funding for the moderni@@ zation of production lines would not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Greater Middle Glas@@ gow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decl@@ ines , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow strongly requires a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with co @-@ workers and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly check our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross office , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the FC Barcelona warn against Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
La Liga page likes to show her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not drop in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after issu@@ ing an offer of £ 189 million to release its release cl@@ ause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has imposed its way out , although a source close to the Catal@@ an Board insi@@ sts that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .
but has the football world been warned about three years ago by the PSG pres@@ idents in front of this prospect ?
as Manchester City in 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the club Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to rip off under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report on the abuse inci@@ dents reli@@ eves pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; announced after publication of the German press agency , he expected Bishop and present Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine , on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that in reporting on violence at Dom@@ sp@@ atzen I am measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two levels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ments in Regensburg no one finds that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also princ@@ ess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ ws had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with friends as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports of abuse inci@@ dents , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wron@@ g@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who , with R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the mem@@ o@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 547 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 domain sc@@ rape sex@@ ually ab@@ used .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reli@@ ed on his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of violence exercise at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives a contradi@@ ct@@ ory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for one , many pupils emphas@@ ise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a cholesterol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more tan@@ gible when a cathedral sp@@ inning brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you value this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all .
there are just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
you can , at best , throw him out , know too late or have not taken first interpre@@ tations seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm heart@@ edly , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured instruc@@ tors who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high levels of emoti@@ on@@ ality , which already led to breeding @-@ breeding .
the fact that he did not only cr@@ ush with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also distributed ear @-@ files and too fre@@ che boys pulled to the hair or ears , he himself had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods as well ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
even I have experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , it is , of course , Bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it is not more of his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e , many people who have never understood him are still working ze@@ al@@ ously .
but the truth is : the report takes relief from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , much about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen had been reported in connection with the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be responsible for any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aul@@ ts claims to have entrusted itself to the master cap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the aff@@ licted on the other , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that reck@@ oned to him ... bu@@ ds more ha@@ unting or clear@@ er or more open than against their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ory leaders , confidence teachers , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report conclu@@ des with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up affected students and / or their environment , they could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any complic@@ ity .
he cannot be accused of having prevented him from being prevented or brought to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradi@@ ct@@ ory crimes , as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ty@@ ran@@ ny eating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cathedral kap@@ ell@@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed up became a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
that is , namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the domain @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
the report also deals with occur@@ ren@@ ces from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir leader of the domain @-@ cats .
all the terrible examination ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were quite schi@@ ed@@ ul@@ led and mal@@ igned , and there@@ under horri@@ bly suffered , all of them took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prev@@ ailed .
but with which Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
on that was , as most of the witnesses pointed out , the subject of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; para@@ dis@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , at the most , the re@@ pro@@ ach remains to be om@@ itted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and was at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then returned to 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger resol@@ utely closed the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the pre @-@ school continues to prac@@ tise the sentence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative pres@@ crip@@ tions , he recommended urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as a law of law , had long been forbidden in Bavaria .
before that they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult for him to assess where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not possible to say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 , the trial was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak there from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the danger of evaluating past to present moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princ@@ ess has quite right .
but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse which has been ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what has been v@@ om@@ ited in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond the usual practice .
this is all really aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work up .
but at the same time , I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
to draw its means to discipline and punishment , so to pull ear @-@ files and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then prohibited , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger re@@ produced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing come to language as well ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective that the domain @-@ cats played only a secondary role .
in spite of this , I did not by no means waste that he had a tight reg@@ iment there .
but also this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y alone it is made of rebel@@ li@@ ous boys not having a great singer and before every success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ indul@@ gence .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again experienced as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply belie@@ ver and hear@@ ty people from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something even a fly .
I regularly come with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his embar@@ ass@@ ment , visit him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not forgive him so far that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the cathedral spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father @-@ like teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but still a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful person to which they still look up today and which they truly honor .
and please , once again clearly : everything that you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now the queu@@ e would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
