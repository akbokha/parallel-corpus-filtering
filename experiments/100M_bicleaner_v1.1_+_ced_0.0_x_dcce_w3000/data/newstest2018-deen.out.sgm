<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to get exciting, because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a walk-in road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria in the state government, are anything but up to date - but therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in the big overview map, detailed maps, so-called" "" "Urpositionsblätter" "" "were incorporated for cities and communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned Bavaria's topographic recording - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally withdrawn with the Peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositionsblatt for Munich originates from 1856 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison to earlier / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the drawing of the map, i.e. 1877, as a district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in the zooming a small-scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered plots of the so-called "urgency" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots present no farmers anymore - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of the present district au-Haidhausen we read not only street names "am Gasteig" or from the "On the Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once again blocked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudrun headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called" "" "Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, and later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the central sirens in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich east, east of residential buildings dating back to the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015 the children house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Haupt Platz" "" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to promote coloured people has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, demands afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state, which disproportionate minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that people happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted or killed because of their skin colour, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no longer any gasoline during the voyage and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without accusing a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Public Prosecutor's Office in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whiteness.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring about chewing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted about 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program that classifies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states committed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further race-racial profiling in view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to specific laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Orders Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the square of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the CDU local community met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his operation, in which he cultivated 55 acres of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.</seg>

<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much must be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "emphasised Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the eleventh operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "Mr. Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hope that the afforestation of the faces could be withdrawn for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The storage area is therefore 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by a leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac emphasised:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers' wives it is not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also Peter Weiß asserted:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape path directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state funding of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the black forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area must not be traced manageable (slope above 35 percent) and therefore must be threatened by the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fisherman Weidezaunproject 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build up almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The storage area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have landed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it intervened, and in particular the significance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta described: "I don't want to go down here for a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem on which you refer to which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your rubbish, your arms, and your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the poor waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "living apostasy" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in the USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a depicting classic image portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she has a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatism that the American flame puts into the reclaimed world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausting, but hopeful people after long and often horrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wish to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in the medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate colleagues voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>

<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is why the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum - is considered official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans MEP Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of silence or spamming or hateful people who wave the whip online.</seg>

<seg id="429">The Tesla CEO, however, does not believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>

<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, unprecedented production lines without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the jubilee of the church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16 at 16: 30.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the resort, the historical St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>

<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village Kleinod." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, there was also a glorious courtyard beside the former parish church, to which the church or patron was right and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the village and Oberdorf, which today are still recognizable in the town picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the most beautiful settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are underlining these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage was formed from the Early Medieval Church Law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two grabs at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the windows were inserted and the bell sections were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower could be left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's snakes in 1834 a storm turned the steeple and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower werg existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem have maintained the Hilarius system as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumblgens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>

<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, on which the City of Viersen was indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city councillor gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars Weltrekord transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to forbid teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play Rules, which have been launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG must point at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money easygoing to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power rich by the power of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Players are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but with legitimate income sources, they will have to give them the break-even point in their work-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had enormous debts in their quest for success would effectively deceive and risk to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which originally used Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini 2015 has fallen by the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will step up the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">"" "" "" "Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements." ""</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has hit the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG earned a fine of 60 million Euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million Euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs trying to superimpose their financial supervision by raising their income through companies connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan enterprise could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market value, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar WM ambassadors will be and such a maneuver could easily find out for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to adhere to any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest reports show that, in 2015 / 16, a revenue of €542.4 million has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expected that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and trikotsales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of the story is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year Grunge era (when the Vordenker David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch-Comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise, it feels like the time would be scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By sticking up at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play tight children who grow up - nevertheless they made the impossibility to regain the final part of the Witzky.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the foundational principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90-th years like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that the cradle looks").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point a character shoots through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-bignant plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good idea by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons Unterippenbart from "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">"" "it's the moments of random madness that might incense this franchise like a kind of repetitive" "" "seven Up!"

"" ""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West-West Ringling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as a director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the road of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-minded Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piero Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synced in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to see (the police spend the time watching chess on television, how Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent match 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan Mask - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">In six long episodes it is gone, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was edited down to a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, because Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel mill is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled the fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille Lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, mirroring is like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable cues are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage room, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the bottom size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials, which give space its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and thus help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electric sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard in something entirely amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate Imperial Victoria's worth over 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and designer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>

<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 "s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, it will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new head of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more evocative course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumpet's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that was thrown into the hands of the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television extends decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Kandidat Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places that were persuaded," said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control according to six ex-election officials is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign owners know something that we don't know about others - that Trumpets would have contained more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees have done it several times to keep trouble from him, their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoided the fact that Trump is causing controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may propel their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisors to lead the president for strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he tries to find out where these come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This is exactly what happened at the end of February, when somebody accused the President of a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "the source of being a heap of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Schikanen, or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and voiced her.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "attempted to implement a system to manage and document paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1st March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Due to the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel through the then ambience Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a gathering accommodation, which ensured controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt, mayor Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that Trump has personally brought Trump into the centre and investigate whether the President could possibly obstruct the judiciary in the wake of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Accordingly, Grand Jury are also called the Indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>

<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, pre-invitations were issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trumpet's consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former Elector Paul Manafort were at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the implementation shows that Mueller does not shy away in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act fast.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the Gremidium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for anxiety for President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed because of this, it was in the statement further.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this reproach, accusations against Trump have become noisy; they want to obstruct the judiciary." ""</seg>

<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg, is unclear according to research figures.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facet background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this horseshoe the balance of waxes and vomiting was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-Researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete shot-file.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn so far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under suspense and can crumble if a piece is broken down in a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and displace the ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice sheet causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only very low, the British research project for observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>

<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collapsing, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, the Antarctic Peninsula has collapsed in recent decades.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German relief organization 'Jugend Rettet', because their crew had worked together effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one such encounter occurred allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Public Prosecutor's Act, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>

<seg id="1632">Ingo FROBÖSE has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases that transmit insects, leading scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, big headaches prepared.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which in the spring brought much less rain and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zicad, a micro-bacterium that carries the Zwergzikaden, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil does not only attract tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evaporation of evaporation from the ground, but also spraying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly magazine Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children to the office who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perception and gut feelings reach.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto commenced his office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear t-shirts, showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010, in order to process the cases of journalists, it initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are not comforting and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we suspend all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He was only able to ride a few blocks until his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rivalising factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street each day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug kings who are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke away with guilt because he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Damian, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newsboxes.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after confiscation of another newspaper publishing the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined forces with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 U.S. dollars into shares.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate Journalism without encountering the poison of drugs," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper competed a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to be able to publish hard work without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else had to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, it received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" "" "for their coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave up that he was afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce-Team misses Valdez, the little bird, who was able to curb like a dockyard, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there always at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer considered in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size Culiacan area.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen owned by the governor themselves as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has curred three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures that focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this area, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers had viewed Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a couple of signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by having written "SOS Press" in organized protests and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists, because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, participating government officials and a society of equality.</seg>
<seg id="1895">"" "in his last book" "" "Narco-Journalism" "", "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime." ""</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this plant-eater although it is covered with armor and resembles a wall-changing tank, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfeit, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to get better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts predict that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta markmitchelli named after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>

<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodose-rier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on pointers about his life, including his counterpart Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and pushed into the sea where he sank on the back to the seabed.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>

<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between the driver and the passenger, which leads to bad mood in the section or greater room and delays in the control of your own tickets and takes the Schaffner at the end time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whosly Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment which they rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confused, because no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lemoned body that was stretched on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "it is wild," "" "thought Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She turned her cell phone to return to tweets on people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"" "there were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a shield with the inscription:" "" "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th century.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the viewpoint of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell, with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown to Ferguson, the two had a conversation, which they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any disgusting racism, she is not unlike the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would have a bad service to keep them off." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a territory when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism changed totally after August 9," "" "she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it is all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came Ferrell in mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and grown up in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already collaborated with the Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Death Road inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought the project closer to Ferrell, together with six other locals followed the White Streets team? "in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we're talking," "" "said Davis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for this is how I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrando's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents from" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrando's life as she falls in love with her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrando's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have overall carried the movement," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the main burden of all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action" "" "where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news agency in Ferguson has long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"" "it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that it calls its home:" "" "a chaos." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work, the end will end.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manns DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which resemble almost imperceptibly resemble cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarincisions, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst became a 35-year prison sentence, after being secretly classified as secret diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called a Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a translady and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from panning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but openly talking about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white self-ie, in which Manning deliberately sits comfortably on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wiwig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette sleeves and chewing gum, by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal briberies, which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic called "Suppressed Image," illustrated by Shoei Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President Chelepa would turn judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand was a welcome type of happy encounter.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces in order to find new, tweetable ways to inflame the rigid splits he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all of these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"" "in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning with its superior signature among them (the" "" "i" "" "in their surname is marked with a heart) an end to the" "" "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people hopefully will take with them is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-work of 2007, Spicy Memories, is also to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned cartoon novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how it emerges from the disciplinary arctic of the United States like King Kong with a free-talk efon.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, from its own genomic simulacers, which assemble themselves like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide hunting game is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who are looking for suspects after a man had been killed in a luxurious Chicago home with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Court of Justice show.</seg>

<seg id="2205">The answers were often vague, little helpful, or worse - deceitful.</seg>

<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to perform surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups to address employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers manage to circumvent the C-Suite leaders and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>

<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they must remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former colleague describes a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technical website let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the Uber Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent can send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the principal business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that its employees are badly treated or unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, worker fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has employed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company employs Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment or an unfair traineeship.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to reap ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "Social Media came to their right" "" "that companies recognised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">It received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices, and that the work that you do is worthwhile, then they feel more obliged to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who used both Convercent and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors are reaching Renditen when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow employees," "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem about Glint is reported, so saved.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company has always received new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr Sharkey on the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt his robot according to his beliefs" and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a Stepford woman progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">State-of-the-art Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed characters such as Frigid Farrah, which imparts the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired of conversation, or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it's said on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to a bit darker and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally not hold sex robots, and while FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps from the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing in a time where women's rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been praising women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('Der Report der Magd') are not the graphic pictures, the intricate body and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to its" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have mediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redemption of 2017: maid girls</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney as the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a certainty of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the US voters, also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's selections.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly supposed to let our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power to bring up trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leoped poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone knows it, including the republican relationship with which she fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is important to me that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the dismissal effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "Normalisation" "" "and" "" "Trump," "" "we refer to the scary possibility that our cookies will no longer be aborted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more difficult long-term scenario, in which Trump republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urkomische version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked out) - both in fact seem to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify himself as immeasurable enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climating music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Toppub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience since two two-year old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-th years can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given him the full score but luckily no one asked him afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same as the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to slowing what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetic, while I'm tired of having the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Due to murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder of the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine's Day 2013, shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder that hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to apply this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say it is too transparent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecutor said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the claim could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The guiding researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an in tryptophan rich diet tolerate more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease, if the same system also applies to people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that stimulated tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was accommodated separately, this did not have.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria work on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent, but if the tryptophane values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophane values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen's report on the abuse incidents relieves pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church," announced after publication of the German press agency, he expected Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "magazine, on the other hand, criticised the fact that in reporting on violence at Domspatzen I am measured with" "" "two levels" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the encroachments in Regensburg no one finds that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it for normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like to go to the church and this is a found frescoes." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports of abuse incidents, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, wrote the memoir" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take George Ratzinger's protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 domain scrape sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotion, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relied on his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence exercise at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many pupils emphasise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a cholesterol and perfectionist, which became more tangible when a cathedral spinning brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you value this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can, at best, throw him out, know too late or have not taken first interpretations seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as - literally -" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent testimony, describes it as "warm heartedly," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured instructors who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high levels of emotionality, which already led to breeding-breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only crush with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also distributed ear-files and too freche boys pulled to the hair or ears, he himself had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Even I have experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, it is, of course, Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more of his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope, many people who have never understood him are still working zealously.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report takes relief from Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen had been reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be responsible for any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted itself to the master capellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of the afflicted on the other," "" "it was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that reckoned to him... buds more haunting or clearer or more open than against their parents, dormitory leaders, confidence teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "that in the run-up affected students and / or their environment, they could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of having prevented him from being prevented or brought to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradictory crimes, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "tyranny eating" "" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former cathedral kapellmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking out" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed up became a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">That is, namely, cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the domain-cats, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also deals with occurrences from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the domain-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible examination pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers were quite schiedulled and maligned, and thereunder horribly suffered, all of them took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with which Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was, as most of the witnesses pointed out, the subject of "pre-school" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradises" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not a sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">"" "" "" "so, at the most, the reproach remains to be omitted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish himself and was at a school where he was not working and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then returned to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger resolutely closed the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report was reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "that the pre-school continues to practise the sentence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative prescriptions, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as a law of law, had long been forbidden in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"" "" "" "it was difficult for him to assess where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded." ""</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it is not possible to say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the trial was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians speak there from the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "the danger of evaluating past to present moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse which has been abhorred at all times and also not for what has been vomited in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all really awful and I'm glad that it will finally work up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take George Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">To draw its means to discipline and punishment, so to pull ear-files and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his" "" "Regensburger" "" "has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing come to language as well?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the domain-cats played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In spite of this, I did not by no means waste that he had a tight regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone it is made of rebellious boys not having a great singer and before every success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-indulgence.</seg>
