28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco M@@ all
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping m@@ all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim testi@@ fied that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field M@@ all , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , distributed the cor@@ ridor department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who earlier worked as a cook in Boston , had taken his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked and destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ icia suggested that Frank was initially in host@@ els , but that &quot; things went uphill for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girl@@ friend , &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia predicted that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to combine his style with his family was to cook us always something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ skilled diamond , who lit bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD on the number 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;ll always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has clearly made Hollywood star clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are somewhat sn@@ ug@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; she asks the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger examined some di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden Pyr@@ amid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their celebration , they ch@@ ased away at home to feed fe@@ eders in a fast g@@ allo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with it the riding career then ended again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament vict@@ ories - again near horses .
he left his family over the plant of the RV , on a horse he did not even s@@ wear for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with CHI@@ O .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ilfe was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala the Gold Sports Pyr@@ amid .
there is no lack of awards for the sympath@@ etic sport@@ spe@@ ople .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ beer@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ elt him .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting junior staff .
and so he also gave the $ 25,@@ 000 prize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold US master winner was added on Saturday to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ reiter Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport exhau@@ sts came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ field , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are on the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts as small as the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to best@@ ow the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely rep@@ ay regul@@ ators , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be invested in that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost word @-@ like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there could therefore be parti@@ san discussions on tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris Climate Change Agreement wants to termin@@ ate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to explicitly expand and demand the Renew@@ able Energy with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather just protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should then be paid better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage of hunger .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage does not need to be changed , then he says he should not be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics prevented him so that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , which wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who alone are fle@@ eing , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he gaz@@ es curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an executive director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and also deals with the issue of women on the flight .
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope bear@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are other reasons for the escape in women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( # 1.07 Out of the Past ) ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr tells us .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worst ab@@ used .
this leads to the fact that about 90 per cent of the women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so ac@@ custom@@ ed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , more accommodations need only for them , B@@ ahr calls for .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the lodging of refugees .
on the question whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer no .
there is no such thing in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some community @-@ related floors or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published by the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will find men and women together , it can come to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and can be easily accessible for women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this protective need can be read at the And@@ rang &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which gives it to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
assistance doctors strike : demands for new employment measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the Regist@@ rar Sur@@ geons have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their dispute relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work activities from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that there would have been ministers appointed to respond to concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in elections .
in a letter to the members that was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which meant that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Management Board has voted in favour of completely re@@ jec@@ ting the proposed new treaty and requested official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Bureau today made a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating unemployment measures beginning in early September .
the disputes led to the fact that assist@@ ants of this year struck six times , the first total failure in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the B@@ MA assistant physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election for the rejection of the agreed contract conditions , which had been advised by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ actor in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace in reception , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin sm@@ iles sm@@ alli@@ g@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan beha@@ ved as if something would never happen .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state did not forget Russia .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his intro@@ duc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow response to the time was ou@@ trag@@ eous .
Putin distributed and accused Ankara to be fallen into the back .
the passing was even greater since it was made by a supposed friend .
building the v@@ etr@@ ack will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a heavy , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria that are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use of President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could win a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan , primarily , needs all the friends he can get after he was dismis@@ sed during the last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ umed .
they count on a late @-@ imperial rush to the Mediterranean .
this week the State television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state in Ankara won a bonus for sure that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he called for support for the elected bodies of the state .
for Moscow , this is a matter of course , a matter of course , which even has a deep anxiety over regime change .
the summit in this brilliant palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that have fallen off from the west and are badly treated and are now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents spoke at the press conference that they didn &apos;t even seize the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin chose to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found to Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since then dist@@ anced itself , when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time brand names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized head@@ quarter and stock exchange will change to Nat@@ alia .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue any global objectives but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer lead its Six Nations Sponsor and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , for how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that New@@ market happened because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .

Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans thr@@ illed fans for years for this kind of sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6,000 profits if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already been winning almost 30 years of winning in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .

Russian Putin che@@ ats Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismis@@ sed Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ant .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed as a Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s has ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been appointed Ivan@@ ov@@ s Sub@@ stitute since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious State University of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the emb@@ assy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website ( in Russian ) it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Head of Staff of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
im@@ press the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow secret .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest colleagues and worked as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official claim - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : it is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could say this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust to embarrass@@ ing post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been the Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he most trusted .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close to Putin &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination at the Set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , exc@@ used publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons is written out of the series , which follows a Team of F@@ BI agents , will probably be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart &apos;s blood into the last 12 years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross dres@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four clos@@ ings to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck@@ le blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are near@@ ing completion to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10.000 tons of steel and 20.000 tonnes of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ t rop@@ es .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown once visited the building site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross dres@@ sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering art of truly epic proportions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tri@@ cky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck in its place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks get a ton for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this fantastic project , the closure is future @-@ oriented up@@ - and deep @-@ construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the extension , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or north side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern Zu@@ bring@@ er@@ brücke bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
un@@ cle , because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they only pressed a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky enough to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station crashed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had trouble swimming while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blowing the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man at the age of 60 exhausted and hang@@ ed on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat motor had an emergency stop , but this was loos@@ ing the boat from the person who was steering the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
seriously injured - a man stab@@ bed on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal belong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic ha@@ yst@@ er cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .

together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her companions .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ li@@ fel@@ ess .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ g@@ ites affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken into duty much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one respond to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a scheme is missing until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD spokes@@ man Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also be found in the stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main issue in the town hall is , however , the Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors in such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing construction programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incen@@ tives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU aims to make investors a few rules as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er constraints for investors .
regardless of the so @-@ called &quot; Brat@@ mann , &quot; a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is obvious .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is still not entirely up @-@ to @-@ date : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one reconc@@ ile the loss of further 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose funding is going to run over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planning oli@@ tical spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought off @-@ running bonds from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to return apartments back to the pricing .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
in one fell , the problem could be solved .
because in the West@@ stadt run at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the west city is increasing dras@@ tically again , one remo@@ ves from the aim of so @-@ called confusion .
there should be no more concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the C@@ DU must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that there can &apos;t be a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worthwhile
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go out to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and recently restricted to smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created initially for video games in the 1990s ( later created a carto@@ on , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers were over@@ loaded .
within days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( using a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35,@@ 000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tracking people who exercise 30 minutes each day , le@@ aped 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on de@@ af ears because many public messages about health are d@@ ull and coming from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the mir@@ ac@@ ulous at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even lock new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ ric game spo@@ ilers that always have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the dunes
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the entire line brilliant .
and now also the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast climb@@ ed on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ camera A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ campaign period of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a multi @-@ kamp@@ f@@ ist title and the fifth , while consoli@@ dating her reputation , being the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success is in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that involve a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it anticipated her last examination in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans will hu@@ g Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign group of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ are@@ well party he retired Chief Co@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as excl@@ am@@ ation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is coordinated to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympia Arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since summer 2013 , she has not lost a competition competition , a series of vict@@ ories that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led lightly through two turns , the picture was glo@@ wing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and on the floor with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 .
R@@ ais@@ man embrac@@ ed her gently when they expected her grand@@ child - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ cked on a bright red , white and blue Eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality .
the performance of R@@ ais@@ man was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of cl@@ ub@@ teams , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her flush practice she cast out the audience kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared du@@ bi@@ ous .
as far as it is concerned , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ der@@ ous appl@@ ause when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest ass@@ aul@@ ts of Phoenix for a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ gun while sitting on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police told that the triple mur@@ ders didn &apos;t seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that gun@@ men led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic dwelling @-@ areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the sho@@ ot@@ ings aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple mur@@ ders and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bullet out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto is in love with singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the fe@@ west of his old @-@ age , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let myself on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run a help@@ desk .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or cra@@ wl up until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring it to sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News told him .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause for rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
violent ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , the National weather service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards shared that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already underway to help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vessels , boats and sand bags multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service showed that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches might fall in the rain .
a flood warning system was used in the south of Alab@@ ama on Friday while it was still raining in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record level over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ding many homes in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these rivers flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the occurred rivers .
the flow ticket v@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09@@ .00 .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of flood in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and son &apos;s son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , rose strongly over night .
he said that he had warned him another step @-@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water was flowing and po@@ uring in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the ob@@ struc@@ tions and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities were hes@@ it@@ ant to take account of evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was significantly weigh@@ ed by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and Te@@ aching Out@@ rage in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subsi@@ dy in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 over@@ flo@@ wed homes .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which were both floo@@ ded now .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by floo@@ ds .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the floo@@ d@@ water and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison count@@ ys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday they have not been reported .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places I never saw before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police told us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents believed that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the lo@@ oming , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was considered cri@@ tically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical state , reports the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there had come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the road , on both sides of the walk , there were sleeves .
so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; told police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently evaluating the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross r@@ ack@@ et on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present at the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that for more than one reason .
first I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this squ@@ ad , which is A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Katholi@@ kin , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected , yet master@@ ly G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americ@@ ana , who won gold in an individual campaign for women .
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ asi@@ ums across the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to bring it to the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic Games will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily in private trainers , which are maintained by parents responsible for training , furnish@@ ing , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ clubs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their whole training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we need to make the municipalities au@@ n numerous young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ as@@ tics training .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
during my events we have offered free and affordable vacation gymn@@ asts in Harlem for more than 15,@@ 000 urban teenagers ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and coach national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by h@@ itting the Olympic team and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes through the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ .000 assist@@ ants who voted for election were rejected .
in July , H@@ unt &apos;s plans were un@@ veiled , for@@ ci@@ bly introducing the treaty and said that the N@@ HS had been found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work , in order to improve maintenance during idle times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assist@@ ants last night in a message with : &quot; assistant physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially that it will inc@@ ite the current workforce and will admini@@ ster it , treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by discussions with the government on rel@@ u@@ ctance to participate and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence .
this was the case of a promise made by Jerem@@ y H@@ unt in the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now to raise the condition and address the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further activities .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting medical doctors on the stri@@ kers chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA aims to provide better week@@ end@@ re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employment measures achieve nothing of the only little but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , peac@@ o@@ cks and their families only concerns , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to the committee of the assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns about the pat@@ ernity and whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es .
employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility for training , additional training for those who come back from a vocational training , training course , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ancy and the Ministry of Health concerning the adher@@ ence to agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro tag@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after it was advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the inhibit@@ ing drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
approximately 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form layers .
when the surface cr@@ ashes , it can cause a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting causing the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solve , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory draft of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or combined with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a pro@@ visional recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness &apos;s culture blo@@ oming in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report for corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread elec@@ toral fraud in Muslim communities is kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored as a devast@@ ating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member , Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , hi@@ des the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ ouses to ignore the evidence of election abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an antagon@@ ism king , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious moti@@ fs is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ toral cabins to protect ou@@ trag@@ eous vot@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should take a card to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er merely needs to call his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink on the finger of a person if they give off their vote , to prevent someone choos@@ es twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against elec@@ toral fraud , but also aims to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s elec@@ toral scale in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; and that he had brought his critics to silence with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man shall have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person choos@@ es someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he expressed al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent postal code - in which senior members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including guiding of ways to prove the identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proving that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or rural background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensi@@ tivities regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition of political activ@@ ist brief@@ ing papers to stop &quot; election harv@@ ests . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the elec@@ toral direc@@ torate being used for immigration and social welfare purposes .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable fl@@ aps on the finger of a person as soon as she gave her voice to prevent anyone choosing twice .
systematic review of the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation of applications to an automatic letter code .
ban that political activists deal full letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ op@@ es of letter sel@@ ections .
the police give authority to set off barriers to elec@@ toral stations .
a change of law , which makes an accus@@ ation easier for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
Fot@@ ograf@@ ieren ver@@ bot in Wahl@@ stationen .
request that only English may be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees generally asser@@ t that vot@@ ers go alone to the elec@@ toral cab@@ ine .
Sir Eric dis@@ covers the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral dish has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his dep@@ u@@ ties for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was ple@@ aded guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ toral regi@@ str@@ ations of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court judgement in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of elec@@ toral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic sports@@ men in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of the French cycling sports@@ woman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except Rand and Band , which proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic@@ in is by far not the only ath@@ l@@ ete which has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ads that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US squ@@ ad in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the cycle track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain arch@@ ers of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I &apos;ll do it as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year &apos;s attention : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford &apos;s British Wei@@ t@@ sp@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes aims to pass through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ c@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blond hair as the ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord on , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the ac@@ tress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the Gold Med@@ al in Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile resem@@ bling the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; like M@@ ief went off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ D@@ onal@@ ds thought that his microphone was turned off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free fre@@ estyle swi@@ vel .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; paint , &quot; one could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chinese woman lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went like M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thanks for this .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to un@@ lock the gap to China .
viewers throughout Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year old guy from China &quot; like a pig has died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows at the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fre@@ estyle swi@@ vel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many asked him to speak .
Twitter users didn &apos;t go back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # by@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like r@@ assi@@ sts . # disgu@@ sted .
shortly afterwards , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ happy choice , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the commentary consultant Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed swi@@ ft@@ ly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ d@@ onald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the power of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ trag@@ ed by women who tast@@ ed under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try out pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered , as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelves .
she continued and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman rehear@@ sed the pants before she put her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she pulled out and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the shop floor she took a couple of pants out of the tray , pulled out their own trun@@ ks and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ ly as Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she did nothing to get out and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone who was observing someone - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the pants he had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to bear in mind that someone would take under@@ pants home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and she was not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com may make it safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to spin the sk@@ e@@ wer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as a first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the fir@@ ing line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before casting it into your face with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the body and rot@@ ate while the att@@ acker cl@@ aws in front of pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel into the face and move back@@ wards while holding the gun on it .
with att@@ ackers coming from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the fire@@ line , grab the gun and rot@@ ate it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
shift the weight on the gun at the same time and beat the att@@ acker onto the chest , then rot@@ ate the gun from its grip before moving back@@ wards and turning the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes it Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it &apos;s saf@@ est to pass your money on a rob@@ ber@@ y - unless you are a Grand@@ master of Mag@@ a .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and thro@@ ws a serious test - by li@@ cking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k under@@ went his course on a Euro banknotes , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a kno@@ b of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the res@@ ili@@ ence of his immune system .
prior to the emp@@ t@@ ying of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title of &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results .
the thought of le@@ aning the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his dar@@ mes by traveling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task put its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was in any case justified .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample score showed a lumin@@ escence number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ escence number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to le@@ ak after its lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial count at different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have had in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy products Vali@@ o .
the Company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us containing both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we launched crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking just about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film director , added : &quot; let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had raised some of the things I wanted to lick him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria were particularly associated with the well @-@ being of g@@ astro@@ intestinal and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they may at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ og@@ ation of social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 , because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been cast after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed fl@@ ap holes , wooden boards were ri@@ pped , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ licted on street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ets , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ kers and floo@@ ds .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will possibly be torn down , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
there were drugs tra@@ ded in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past .
neighbours said they faced them on the street and regularly had to inv@@ ade the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner tremend@@ ously from the property after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t compl@@ ain about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have agreed with the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to whom the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the church home , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant had agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step considering Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and had to be horri@@ bly mi@@ tig@@ ated for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have been cour@@ ageous to us and have given us the information we have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbours and the message convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the ground
workers of the house administration will now have to clean gar@@ bage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in commercial cust@@ ody .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will del@@ og@@ ate ten@@ ants that don &apos;t stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ indul@@ gence as well as to those who were har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners in order to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after an effective military jet flies fly
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the air forces put an unbelievable storm
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was pre@@ valent
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a powerful jet r@@ ushes over a full beach .
dramatic video foot@@ age showed how the military plane flew almost in tan@@ gible proximity to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sp@@ rang up when they began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came to them by the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew over twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno Arro@@ yo added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane dropped down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on air@@ plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said the jet was slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people came to death on Madeira island .
the Portuguese war@@ ri@@ ors today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and br@@ anding - that restri@@ cts his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with cares for Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona won first stage win in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup west@@ ward against FC Sevilla , the bac@@ kl@@ ash takes place three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Double@@ winner must rel@@ inqu@@ ish with the lower cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning European le@@ ague champion , among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
furthermore , also Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andre ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a b@@ ust change in the training in the training , with which the enquiry at Bar@@ ca was at least clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen tra@@ ded in Barcelona for two years now as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique had so far rejected a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the le@@ ague , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the rest of the race wins .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness status of the squ@@ ad , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 at the Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla once again won the 2 : 3 defeat after extending the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and asp@@ ires for the second triumph at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
MA Long in a le@@ ague table for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World Ran@@ king First won the Golden Grand Sl@@ am with achievements in World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tour@@ nament and even Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title together .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five Rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S N@@ Ö Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between sentences and time @-@ outs they did not have coaches .
they had with@@ drawn to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors at a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches until now for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fin@@ als I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said consequently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver medals posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
MA had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
then he set the pace on the record and made Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected stir@@ ring match .
nevertheless , nevertheless , enough stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Miz@@ pe@@ ani won the game for the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russians had drawn up a rif@@ le injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with lead .

Donald Tr@@ ump ap@@ points &quot; massive problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave rise to weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which the mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire usually appearing large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals from the race within its own republi@@ can camp , the doubts rise to its success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ ilt were false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well @-@ known media .
Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ cloth
Ut@@ ah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ er from June , Tr@@ ump and his ri@@ val fell from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes nothing else than telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not reach for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened tr@@ ump to submit money to support his elec@@ toral campaign , he should not present better surveys .
instead , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans want to grab more under the arms for Congress .
Olympia : tri@@ une betra@@ yal by dop@@ ing @-@ test
the I@@ OC intends to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a sei@@ z@@ ure test in a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee informed us to immediately set up a disciplinary commission in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told us that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had given a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the team @-@ management Ken@@ yan by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the I@@ OC to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the I@@ OC , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and was issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the athletes who stood on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Leicht@@ athle@@ tik @-@ Deleg@@ ation@@ sch@@ ef Michael Rot@@ ich was de@@ duc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is said to have informed the athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
in the I@@ OC in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing tests , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the I@@ OC , more than 2,000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio Olympics have been pointed out , however , that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken to the sights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
subsequently , the W@@ ADA Kenya took off the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the W@@ ADA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD they have repeatedly raised accus@@ ations that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar study in Kenya as he had employed in Russian Athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that this kind of sport was nation@@ wide and systematically ged@@ opt .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with her a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have am@@ ber music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls with nostal@@ gia to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .

London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , IT@@ V news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family &apos;s information shortly after she had prepared to leave the country of war and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it to go into a war zone - people from ever holding this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from east of London went to an air@@ plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas family was told that she married an I@@ SIS fighter in Syria - and was wi@@ dow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says , Clinton will be candidates for the Supreme Court in case of election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Sen@@ at Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the de@@ ceased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects of Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Rei@@ d later told that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ tons &apos; team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the United States Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .

Tre@@ ats wants N@@ eck @-@ Calendar for Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with the photographer David BEL@@ LE@@ MER@@ E to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his n@@ ude magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes us since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the view that it does the calendar also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classic naked where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ closest Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons at short notice with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the harsh criticism of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand prot@@ ections from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with stra@@ in@@ ers three months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup , there were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Tur@@ ks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start new in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refuge refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef compl@@ ained about the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
with this Erdo@@ gan just wants to increase the spin @-@ off on the remaining cur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or displac@@ ed in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the C@@ DU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef called for the federal government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as hot as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ Cri@@ tic takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
more Tur@@ ks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
Brand@@ mark@@ ung as a Gü@@ len practition@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports under appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Tur@@ ks already presented the largest group of asylum entitled refugees recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people , and therefore nearly 29 percent of all known as the asylum @-@ seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
according to the Basic Law , asylum rights are exclusively political , i.e. by the state side , individually persec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to W@@ eh@@ ill &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania : the n@@ atives don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 is not going to take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more stup@@ idity than to date it is not : summer holidays , heat and land bal@@ dness - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the elec@@ toral champ@@ ions , are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the land tag .
in addition , practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count voices in the end can only be lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the elec@@ toral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign to the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / C@@ DU coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the C@@ DU in surveys .
how heavily ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D is cut off and what remains at the end of coalition break@@ age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary word @-@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the gu@@ ilt on the blos@@ som@@ ing of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU with its nick@@ name , the Minister of the Interior , Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major media revel@@ ations ; Merkel federal sw@@ ath group lies in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the C@@ DU in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany too .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ C@@ DU wai@@ ves the usual elec@@ toral disputes on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that in the country you are br@@ ittle that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the country &apos;s expan@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the C@@ DU elec@@ toral champion , Kok@@ ert on his comrades , is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Cel@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats last at least 22 percent behind partner C@@ DU ( 25 ) and just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still able to win 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the C@@ DU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue out of their emergency and share their campaign largely in the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green poll@@ s go on track search for native vot@@ ers among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Silke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ vy with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg L@@ akes and finds it even more beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am and finish only at 8@@ pm , there are all praise of praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
this also applies to the development of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to furnish@@ ing behavi@@ ours .
since the construction site was moved south on Monday and also the block of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg again exists , the traffic situation within the village was relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were sometimes significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Florian King , responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the re@@ organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach Roll@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eps were seeking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ ch@@ ised in residential areas .
as also the speed limits were not met , the congregation reinforced the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant floo@@ ds , &quot; says King , who made himself very kno@@ wled@@ geable about the situation .
two to three per minute have been scrat@@ ched .
the fastest was on the pace of 77 km in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to revenue streams , anyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus produced for other companies , for which the refur@@ bish@@ ment has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also scrap@@ es that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most captured are the local pubs along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , vor@@ mals Krone , finds considerable words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we need to be happy about any Euro turnover .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must have dismis@@ sed half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed , the policy would have re@@ acted in a different way .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , answered , the restaurant profit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it also has to bear the draw@@ backs that arise through the renovation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other administrative districts , where such a kind of gener@@ osity has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
the fact that other regular guests pass less frequently due to the complicated traffic situation , he can understand .
if you cannot drive , it is also somewhere else .
that his stem cell returns to the end of the rehabilitation work , there is no doubt about it .
despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the effects of B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of building work , this is already brutal .

according to the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a big security package .
but what do you have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the hi@@ rel@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Interior Minister in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Interior Minister , however , he was given to results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has left a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for safety in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should care for the attacks of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger information and tru@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reputation for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is launching a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put down sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult spots for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the C@@ DU @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that does not have any chances at the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ aining people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are specifically picked up in the country should be checked their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the event of Dul@@ se for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse jobs than to date - such as those who commit crimes or kno@@ w@@ ingly throw their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
some still works un@@ exp@@ elled and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ er@@ zburg have been refugees .
moreover , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that are deeply devoted to the human being let themselves be not cl@@ inging to election times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inner security is enorm@@ ously caught in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ toral competitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days the two parties went high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a dark quar@@ rel on the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also struggles for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t get anything from a rep@@ lica of the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not expe@@ dient .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it only needs to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
but the SPD is also trying to profile inner security on the topic of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel gener@@ alizes first caution and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still running lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures rise worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with the deliveries .
throughout the course of the year , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer , despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , can still show a plus .
but in July , the core brand VW , especially in Western Europe , weak@@ ened the total sales , as reported by the company in D@@ ax .
in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold around the world , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars than last year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , China was the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market Germany deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
Mark@@ enver@@ trieb@@ she@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann has led the we@@ aker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a department store . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also deb@@ ited , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
group sales head Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance sales plans from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting to the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW stated that the re@@ building of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer asked the customer after the conversion a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is legal refin@@ ement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen would now consider its German customers a guarantee of res@@ ili@@ ent diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives last Monday in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; stated by the Ministry of Transport , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deteri@@ or@@ ations in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting will not take place and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers might come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the customer interest it is important to avoid that in any other damage , which has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , a uncertainty concerning possible warranty regulations comes as it was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on g@@ ust or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : normal Spar@@ es must &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not be afraid of paying for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee covers the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on g@@ ust or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; Paul said .
for some time he be@@ ware 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not be able to utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and create 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of Banking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put down for each million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now proce@@ eding according to the poll@@ uter &apos;s principle .
easy to leave cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank v@@ aul@@ ts would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; said the bank@@ note .
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business economically is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ - and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their skat@@ bank branch in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nation@@ wide compensation for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that &apos;s endo@@ wed with a little more abund@@ antly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it be@@ sto@@ ws money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no further banks known , which comp@@ ute a compensation for deposits from private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ b@@ anken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the customers in Germany will not be able to please this in width . &quot; &quot; &quot;
destination plates : who actually buy vinyl records ?
lon@@ ely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before heading to the comments section , to over@@ see him under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ Alle@@ m@@ ist men of middle ages with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the revival of vinyl records is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oho , wear a modest grey suit and get wild , before I stop , hold my hands and say something determin@@ ate like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly shr@@ inking in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ eram@@ an to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these vinyl records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought would probably be too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vices .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets to meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he also not@@ ices a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to see their old records again .
from the conversations I have led , people usually have gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that plate shops offer a so@@ o@@ thing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received imp@@ etus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects , the happy youth pla@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff inspir@@ es from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month did not yet have listened to .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t own a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably be very concerned , while I was leaf@@ ing through a pile of bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have any record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so that I can put them on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ oriented , less musi@@ c@@ ari@@ ous .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who are coming in slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop , which has devoted the record to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ ump@@ y audience when I go in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ este syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ gri@@ pping pop instead of experimental jazz from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
it &apos;s more than a shopping spre@@ e than a big purchase .
it does not deserve much , therefore the collection of records is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or another , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives off with a loving sigh@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I have the impression to mut@@ ate the jeans @-@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers might send in the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that gives the most for luxury items such as plates .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in record shops in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors in S@@ oho , which exist in reality , record shops and online forums , are not considered .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday night with safety not with the st@@ rolling through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while they avoid the stub@@ born look of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er , who over@@ looks nothing of middle @-@ aged men across the shoulders .

French court ref@@ uses offer on demoli@@ tion of stores in the jungle of refugees
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees are living .
during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary transactions in which individuals within the store sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and which have a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important since the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also concluded that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate 72 pro@@ visional operations , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were absolutely understand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the ra@@ ins was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café des Lag@@ ers , which is operated non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of the living in the jungle has risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals in the course of summer .
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic Games , Rad@@ pro Tony Martin does not want to be under@@ min@@ ed .
&quot; I keep the World Cup in sight , remain confident and fight , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly told me to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in peace which reasons for de@@ bac@@ le had led .
at the time @-@ time world championship in Qatar , Martin actually wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the Olympic champion of Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people playing video games is a huge advantage - Microsoft also wants to benefit from this .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which speci@@ alizes in this hobby .
Microsoft was not sharing the amount of money spent on the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am continued with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch other games while playing , but also att@@ acking yourself .
for example , they can aband@@ on the player missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment items .
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard player starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of E @-@ Sports .
on the way to global media event , Facebook should help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the staff of the start @-@ up , which has its headquarters so far in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moves to the Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , like Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i .
for the customer , nothing is expected to change through the acquisition .
according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video game section around the Xbox console .
the market for streaming video games is growing rapidly .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ test devices are tested , which should be particularly effective .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic rein@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at random points where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ poli@@ ses , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained with a stationary engine .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : his battery lasts five days at un@@ interrupted trade fair operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as travel prohi@@ bitions after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , it is possible to move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with a trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lo@@ wered in the measuring operation so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear in a shot @-@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the blo@@ t from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also bl@@ ur with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 units last year .
UK cat@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ year rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ th rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium .
Fi@@ ji distributed a master@@ class in handling , side qu@@ il@@ ting , backs , line @-@ up , and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ah@@ da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad tro@@ phy of silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the tre@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult road behind him .
eight years ago she lost every match at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonder@@ fully and let the attacks j@@ umped from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners walked 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ or@@ au over@@ looked at the corner .
with four minutes of play , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a pre@@ emin@@ ent t@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the rest@@ art and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u sque@@ e@@ zed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still missing .
this is how it is .
GB cul@@ min@@ ated fundamental changes in the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a tou@@ ch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ap@@ sul@@ ators , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame made the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gs and GB sk@@ ill@@ fully beaten in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown led the boats to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side team , secured the prize - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ ous gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first ru@@ d@@ der to the last , 220 hard P@@ ieve who enter history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all @-@ present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row without a tax @-@ woman , the first women in the history of British sport that laid down such a crit@@ erion .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ ter un@@ skilled use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets which gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sp@@ ong@@ es , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind any gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one is lifting a coach than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago , if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
that &apos;s how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , her first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ rac@@ king in the morning , went to talk more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the captain of the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much it means to me , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something fantastic .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant a lot of pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exempl@@ ary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert Go@@ eller , is retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far exempl@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk ( Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk ) some time ago .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe landed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern far as exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert Go@@ eller , who was 31 years in the association of employees , 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for more cities and villages there are water supply contracts .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Go@@ eller was appointed water manager in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water line construction and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , budget planning , fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ development of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ development of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and you have always added new things because water is spo@@ iling and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived on the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practition@@ er , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe towards Nit@@ ra@@ sen@@ kung before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Go@@ eller , on his part , praised water@@ front Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best man of water and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he drew the well @-@ known well @-@ being and the restructuring of the Union of Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high reservoir at church no@@ is@@ ers on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can also be maintained only because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ ingen with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert Go@@ eller .
soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the meantime eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago is well ahead and now stays private in New York where it is the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something about two years when I sang Scala in Milan , he doesn &apos;t remember anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Erwin Schrot@@ t .
she is now married to Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his li@@ fel@@ ess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , following him will be publicly punished .
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ fired and has a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a candle .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the gun , like the police .
who sees Sven S. , is supposed to call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was year 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Lübeck didn &apos;t want to make any statements about the Ta@@ o@@ ist or the relationship between perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special service ando ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened from green promotion are from the table .
it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Plant in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said the German Federal Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption , to the cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only when the generators are replaced in the steel units , an E@@ EG lev@@ y is 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed German unification with the European Commission on self @-@ power generation .
in this way the status quo is largely written to the previous regulation .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading trade , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied that the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw a mass of steel on the world market in view of the we@@ aker domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw off Chinese steel conc@@ er@@ tos price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , dro@@ op@@ ed import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have been suspended .
un@@ clear how sustainable the price pick@@ up is .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate House@@ wives
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost re@@ ductions .
in doing so , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to excl@@ ude closing of individual works .
some 8,@@ 000 people were employed in the steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers will remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tonnes of good six percent less crude steel than last year &apos;s month , as the German economic association shared steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back to one another for the second month .
production increased by two percent since the beginning of the year .

community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the course of the apprentic@@ eship , she took up the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall alive , she says .
at the same time , she does something good for her health and her mind .
S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the Deutsche Sen@@ ior@@ en@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy in the music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise themselves , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , means h@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Employment Agency of the Sen@@ iors organisations .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in elderly people aw@@ akes many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ affected people de@@ vise long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special achievement is also demanded , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone do so to concentrate not only on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir means h@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I long for something , I will better and a@@ wo@@ ke beyond me - this experience boo@@ sts .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
anyone wanting to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who is listening to a sound next to it ?
if you are looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a sen@@ ior@@ boy , one can simply join in .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
whoever wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can contact the church or church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet research .
those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es h@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a hang@@ over to the cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens have on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ sts also didn &apos;t leave the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the exc@@ itation of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ sts of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great distress such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary School and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ aters also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sts of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a call of little ones who were taken from the throw box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more powerful k@@ itt@@ ens that were raised in addition .
the researchers regard their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet own offspring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when the loop of the very er@@ ect k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop@@ mental with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the male re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were already mothers or not , the biological ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey , another important football match takes place in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even with the susp@@ ending of the state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens should not be imp@@ aired .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing to do with football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
against the former k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
accordingly , the South African living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r should be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempted coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the emergency condition imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , it does not affect the lives of most Tur@@ ks as well as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy watch@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to termin@@ ate on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as workers &quot; club are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
but in view of dramatic experiences in history , however , in view of dramatic experiences , there is a strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree , no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will take place again on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne based in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory note .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will also adopt early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the SÜ@@ PER Li@@ g it was only in sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve done this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the game year went better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ re@@ aks as a SÜ@@ PER@@ PER @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ped@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , standing at the AC Florence , had only announced Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return to the country because of the political situation in the country after his European vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club boss F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the storm would have to be ready to reno@@ un@@ ce about a third of the annual shareholder valued at 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clari@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves about possible motives - but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
in recent days , the authorities have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places .
nor is it clear what group behind the attacks st@@ alls .
the police assigned their officials all over the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the we@@ ary bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian State Department on his homepage recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations will not be abandoned in these provinces .
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ unta .
this gives the military big influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos while the country dri@@ fts towards stability , an improvement of economic conditions and tourism .
the military unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps himself very good to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the insur@@ rec@@ tionary of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stroke of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several regional offices , the Con@@ feder@@ alists in the Bund have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß appointed by the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ult@@ i j@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional Gu@@ ards in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ arten said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Executive Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a younger language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adver@@ t advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is to appeal to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are particularly sus@@ cep@@ tible to this .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports on the contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge about that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the protection of the Constitution , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether or not the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have controlling influence on the party .
this is not disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the marked increase of right @-@ handed crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ sia said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have found in recent years that there can be legally @-@ party structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Gruppe .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or small groups form the attacks on asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes , or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of justice @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried about that many attacks went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers have previously not been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimin@@ als or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes committed by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example C@@ DU , SPD or left who have radi@@ c@@ alised themselves by far @-@ right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympics or World records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly over@@ weight swi@@ mm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his prec@@ urs@@ or with a back stand of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more familiar .
since most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of the wh@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only sm@@ ashed with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of fre@@ estyle , played no role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have also been drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ant from Ä@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to start alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old did not learn to swim only eight months before the Olympics and never completed such a long distance before the competition .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in an accident of an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people have been injured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Coun@@ try@@ side Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to turn out to an opposite truck , which drove partly on the counter@@ part .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ person from the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade fre@@ ed the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency vehicle came to the accident location on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ event@@ ful travellers were brought back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner District of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of se@@ wage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ost 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2,10 Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ denberg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 euros ( until now 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ village 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ e@@ water fee will be increased again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the wast@@ e@@ water price in Az@@ village is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach district council , it was established that under@@ cover for these wast@@ e@@ water installations .
the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ covering basis due to legal bases .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens , as well as industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ost , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the cost increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the wast@@ e@@ water facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calculation period .
Schmidt founded the engra@@ ved stir@@ ring increases with relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wage plants with a very low se@@ wage attack , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution of distribution , for example , expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ation period of the calculation , all three systems had a significant impact on all three systems due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair .
the facility in Az@@ zur@@ ra is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for cat@@ fish , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ denberg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Az@@ village se@@ wage system due to damage .
in the Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl pump@@ ing station , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and after nearly 20 years of operation the first se@@ wage gap had to be extended , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to maintain the water legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came to account for the continued support and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Glei@@ ss Lutz Firm of the Year for White Coll@@ ar Crime Rede@@ ker Sell@@ ner D@@ ahs
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stein@@ häuser made it clear that the expenditure for operation and maintenance was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully sm@@ ashed in the three plants &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , was spar@@ ed in the wast@@ e@@ water installations over the past 20 years .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous in the long run , especially since one cannot extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ e@@ water utility to these facilities , because it concerns sanitary facilities .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were booked .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6,3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell on clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mobili@@ ar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on critic@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat will allow some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already adjacent to absur@@ dity .
you can transform into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ flo@@ wer@@ able , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps arrive at the public .
snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were acc@@ using that the app would propag@@ ate Black@@ face convey@@ ors or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and wo@@ ken che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and in@@ dig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as an hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced rac@@ ism , reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et over the photos were widespread , that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and least unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contra@@ sting of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the fil@@ tering effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ lo@@ wish , but that the gel @-@ face has been drawn into the desc@@ ending extrem@@ ity .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ wire .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counter@@ players - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ chat filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s much harder for such things to go un@@ noticed than it was in the past , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that race @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of diversity in the implementation practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company publish@@ es no figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible which concentr@@ ates on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in their turn , Z@@ hu said that she will let their Snap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ SIS for@@ fei@@ ts I@@ SIS intelligence , sets the Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it had allowed the actual states to be present in a report on Thursday .
the pro@@ visional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the armed forces , intelligence services and the defence budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence agents who reported how superi@@ ors changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly marked a positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on location were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the principal errors in the Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed related problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct reference to the fact that government tops have given orders under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure of their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as I@@ SIS or I@@ SIL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command issues changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of I@@ SIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be supple@@ mented with more detailed insight during the investigation .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defence is underway .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of post @-@ intelligence ass@@ ess@@ ments of I@@ SIL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest @-@ ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indications of interven@@ ing the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s chief inspec@@ tor , which were received after the complaints of Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in an opinion that the ministry of defense would not comment on the congress , while the inspec@@ tions of the inspec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also indicated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts at times have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alle@@ g@@ ation that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alle@@ g@@ ations of the past year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is remin@@ is@@ cent of dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a hand@@ piece about how the former government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to specify government agencies that contrary to the statements of the government air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
the US won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after having fired three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of the women in a match on Thursday vs. India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed the strong Dutch woman a little longer than the other group .
as always the game may end on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising f@@ uss about their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time playing a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ r@@ ack@@ et in her hands for the first time ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to make things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have wi@@ ped the helm completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ri@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and lasted from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and sw@@ ung the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to rent a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
surrounded by the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed by the watch@@ man to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ ast to tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in queu@@ e in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with di@@ m@@ ples , could have been quite under these familiar names that were broadcast to Prime Time , built by sponsors and good @-@ good TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ encing .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade there are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognised : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I tend to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event in Sydney since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so ten@@ derly noticed that many of them , I had asked , did not know that it is an olymp@@ ic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes for competition , there was never won a medal in jumping on the tramp@@ oline and had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , who made it until the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a clo@@ wn school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never ending sensation - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports , which essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rising winners jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ itting and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will be judged according to official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympi@@ as after execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straightforward .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in television transmission also another important goal : the world or the Olympic record .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even touch a spec@@ t@@ ator .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as something ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the tramp@@ oline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ acking and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air @-@ to @-@ air , new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia are on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that ump@@ y prot@@ esters were killed during encounters with the police at shooting changes .
is Ethiopia to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanded to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people burst into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was in@@ accessible .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen shot and kill un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or early this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Committee is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terrorism outside the region , particularly in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at the remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations continued to supp@@ ress repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , where dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or jail , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and do not have any other options except prot@@ esting it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the O@@ g@@ aden National Liber@@ ation Front , which have been more or less constra@@ ined in recent years , exploited the turbul@@ ence and re@@ ar@@ ming itself again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess tend to explo@@ de after years of le@@ uck@@ le under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiopia have been able to communicate with social media , since cheaper smartphones became more and more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so close to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two greatest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , thri@@ ved in the politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are there to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests took place in the areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tig@@ ray , who constitute about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death at a non @-@ public@@ ised disease in 2012 , 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special appoint@@ ees to manipul@@ ate enemies and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively short reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uprising in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to analy@@ tics , were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and that time of disturb@@ ances went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but evi@@ dently , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ances of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ eth@@ ian city , run by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , although it recently reported that it closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his associates to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim to Obama that I@@ SIS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that killed his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication put new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings together his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who strive to protect him during an event@@ ful period of protection , in the peculiar position of declar@@ ing statements that he could not have meant .
after finishing the announcement at an election rally on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump sums up his claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created I@@ SIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et Mr Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation totally serious .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy I@@ SIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this subject .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he had a strong criticism of himself when he thought the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more et@@ ched note , because his surveys have declined further .
a new pol@@ l from N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he rein@@ forces the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provo@@ king his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was ques@@ tioned regarding Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama I@@ SIS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called her back@@ ers , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops out of Iraq .
most of the mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in Mrs. Clinton , served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed I@@ SIS to spread through the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania , on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of carrying on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ umps ap@@ olog@@ ation as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a small cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front was pushed out .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which doubled in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people mour@@ ned for the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ola wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it is also re @-@ invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so @-@ cabin model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ es like cap@@ ers and fried onions .
there are king@@ doms .
the café serves no beer anymore , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez stated that he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also su@@ pers@@ eded by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a customer .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , previously lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the way .
after the verb was closed , she gave up coffee a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was in the coffee and the culture that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ time and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said he did not make a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business took the old office space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to make a special soap for clubs with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said he advanced to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other benefits .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ cooked coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a master customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt was passionate about refined delic@@ acies from Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Hei@@ ghts and are both food histori@@ ans .
CO@@ Es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man was told in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
her latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ por@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream sand@@ wich with olive slices , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ por@@ ter introduced hacker fr@@ ying , this found the couple fitting for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and Bohn@@ en@@ brot .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that the ingredient extends .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be placed in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male Fel@@ dar@@ bei@@ ter and it was served freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ ors the ways with which the country was surrounded by no longer being the land of shame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , stra@@ ined issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ ät was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful species , food resi@@ due , &quot; noticed Zi@@ egel@@ man as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
peculiar bl@@ ends have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction pre@@ tends to taste or even healthy cuisine .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not matching each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing pres@@ crip@@ tions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ ampe like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a festival of historical delic@@ acies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farm &apos;s cuisine in his kitchen , he spoke as the milli@@ on@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining @-@ room and carried a tu@@ g .
he was stran@@ gely alien .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper had no interest in flavors due to Ms. Roos@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dri@@ est ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to its legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said brick , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple admitted to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of w@@ asting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brick @-@ man remembered , &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved something rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tast@@ ed not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ bud@@ ge@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung so far saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers are putting their own life into play in order to attract people from bom@@ bed homes and to help in the war area first aid .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard , showing him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save lives , I think God sees in me a marty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrels of barrel over the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with well a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland has only 150 years of young talent .
lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.@@ 220 metres .
only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle em@@ bos@@ sed lifestyle seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least of a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 392 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this period of life , which means a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist already suspected that Greenland is becoming a stone age .
only l@@ acked the evidence .
Greenland shar@@ ks are hard to observe , finally they live above all in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ ks .
their slow pent@@ ag@@ ons measured them when they were six animals with a transmitter at Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
prey make this shar@@ k anyway : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ avers that tor@@ ch from higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks who took fishermen from Greenland or Sp@@ its@@ bergen from Greenland or Sp@@ its@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest shar@@ k measured 502 centimet@@ ers .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the len@@ tic@@ ular of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably plenty of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a weapon of nuclear ar@@ ming greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of the smallest animal with 220 cm length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their lens nucle@@ us , all major Greenland shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 @-@ cm long Grön@@ land shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k was likely to be 392 years old at 502 centimet@@ ers .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females first get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to order an old age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with the reproduction apparently allow at least one and a half centuries of time .
also this should be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not acci@@ dental .
also the record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck took a 120 year old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on spar@@ ks .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gets lost .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with topics around construction , the municipal council dealt with emphasis on the recent meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee adopted the notification of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the commerci@@ alization of the newly @-@ chosen residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the plot , par@@ c@@ tioning and settlement issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be sur@@ vey@@ ed , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Straß@@ fl@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the blo@@ wers in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au are addressing young families and fur@@ y sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , the volunteers can immediately inform themselves in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
in order to also meet requests to settle further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided not to change the area of land use created in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already declared there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
thus , the city on the Main has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt is most benef@@ iting from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the competence field of the financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether bank@@ ed houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Pass &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they have so far been approved in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is currently taking advantage of major US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Lob@@ by@@ vereinigung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk Council ES@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg st@@ ems from a large fund sector , but it also cuts down in the infrastructure of Dublin as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city boasts easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than the main .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in a ranking of the Unternehmens@@ beratung Mer@@ cer , the city stands in seventh place , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in number 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if quality of life is a matter of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my econom@@ ists .
according to figures from Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal fees from h@@ epatitis C law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck
a US president decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of legal costs incur@@ red from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a claim of damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medication so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion of opinion and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was collected on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decre@@ asing the costs arising during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead to the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C medications , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck mut@@ ually def@@ ens@@ ed one another and took possession of laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir is underlying , the active ingredient in the drug of Gilead .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective German tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation . former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton raised an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publishing house for their book about their term at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax statements from the last ten years .
they paid an effective German tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hid behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is custom@@ ary to publish their tax declar@@ ations for US presidential candidates , even though they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check for his ref@@ usal by tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons Wahl@@ kamp@@ f@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter in relation to the publication of the Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Ad@@ vis@@ ors said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the controls did not end .
Tr@@ ump@@ et critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already declared that his ref@@ usal poses questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business shares and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump invite his tax return to publish .
on Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist from the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , declar@@ ing that this could still be the case .
in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a subject .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate has its seat , has moved into a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was also subjected to a tax check by IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the vot@@ ers and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective German tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons from 2015 showed that only USD 100 of their income was paid as wages , unlike most of all Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which clin@@ ton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promoting Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
natural prot@@ ectors in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from habit@@ ated settlements in people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ p .
the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years , has intensi@@ fied its funding together with the US natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Bank Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , being much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chili cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , mixed with earth , is packed into a con@@ dom together with a fire@@ work body , whose end is fil@@ med up to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spr@@ inkl@@ es fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a hint is usually already enough to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is a ver@@ fer who sho@@ ots a gold @-@ turning fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
municipal council unanim@@ ously decides : no Ki@@ os@@ por@@ ub@@ au at the St. Go@@ ars Rhein@@ u@@ fer

however , the city council now declined unanim@@ ously to the request for the construction of a sales office on the Rhine River near the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ ons built in construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine River , this ki@@ osk is not suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the C@@ DU Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots captiv@@ ated a media tur@@ mo@@ il after reve@@ aling that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre @-@ election as it had requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dismis@@ sed his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s country list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , it is possible that Israel was eliminated and er@@ ased ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel using its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there was &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel requested that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is wi@@ ped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solic@@ itor of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and per@@ plex@@ ed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big response from the internet in which people called it a sc@@ andal .
some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; recre@@ ated the alleged appeal of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; exc@@ used &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the fast @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ y Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse to prot@@ esting Brasi@@ lian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber fin against the prot@@ esters .
the difficulties began when police officers attempted to disper@@ se the students , which led to the fact that the police deployed Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the governor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ est@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er at walls spra@@ ying .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ sive President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismis@@ sed by a vote of the Senate for their dism@@ iss@@ al .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.0 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in stores in the country , shared the ambassador with .
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran climb@@ ed by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade fair was reached by supplies of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan returns from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation delivered around 35,@@ 000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries concerning the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken off last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persi@@ an civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking for a witness : beverage forti@@ fication over@@ falling in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y event on Thursday evening has been committed to the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm called for three dark @-@ dressed people who had embrac@@ ed their faces , from the staff of the beverage market the release of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured does not divide the police .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors were supposed to have been between 1,60 and 1.70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poor@@ ly accessible directly from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors must be sc@@ anned in the direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and can be escaped from the gravel parking area located opposite the parking drive , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 pm ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urg@@ ently report to the police .

eight beautiful and joy@@ ful days spent the children and young people of the social education day group / social group work of Nag@@ old children &apos;s protection association with their car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers on their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker .
in the seclu@@ ded Freizei@@ tzentrum hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was quartered during the first school holiday week .
several full @-@ day trips were on the programme .
one went to board with the visit of the car@@ ess z@@ oos .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims at the gate of mercy
the ministers from the soul care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were met .
in order to bridge the time to the next Romantic passage of all the mini@@ stri@@ es in two years , the Federal Council of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were tested and we finally decided to go to the Bischof@@ s@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year was a special pilgrimage destination during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the open gate of Charity in Freiburg .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern were on their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small party in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s wife is standing and thus the pilgrimage route from Mu@@ en@@ ster was started .
the individual day@@ trips were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but even on the way , the Min@@ is made their way to rock crosses , chap@@ els , or churches in order to sing together a song consisting of specially arranged pilgri@@ m songs .
for the overnight stays there were past@@ ors of local par@@ ishes .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller made a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast at the stage .
on the second day we continued our journey through Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , one entered the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to desc@@ end some 500 metres in the case of the s@@ ull heat and then climb@@ ed again afterwards .
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the closing fl@@ ap to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in Münster in the late afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert was greeted at the evening mass in Münster .
after the worship the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner towers home as Br@@ ite Gold has won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner travelled to fame last night in the cycling team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor role , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . the J@@ ungsp@@ und made the legend proud@@ ly when he stor@@ med his home to win a win from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London in March at the London Railway Championships in London .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as exec@@ utions .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner set up an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the ranks the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ des fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des went to a higher gear to slow him down , and to enable him to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y watched from his position as BBC expert and dropped out Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ di when they climb@@ ed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
in the final round , we set up an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys site , there were indications that after a weak start , he was clearly on the track .
he later returned this statement and there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a phenomen@@ al victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we got so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
this would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next to the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will be in focus with safety .
yesterday , he had argued with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in pupp@@ y time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is rel@@ ying on his strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
it played dr@@ amas in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ fen and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached the perfect moment its climax , will be repeated again .
future of Port@@ land sm@@ el@@ ting due to lifting the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melt of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , since the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and so that all supply contracts will be lifted , as the supplying energy company ha@@ sten@@ ed .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running out in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa installation in Port@@ land stand on the game .
not less than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed at closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium carp@@ entry with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture owned by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ aties have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L agreed that the value of the tre@@ aties was already written in its annual budget of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a dism@@ iss@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; does not imp@@ inge .
the US company said that 2010 has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both plants van@@ ish from the market , this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the vision brought me to cry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizar@@ re ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) , sponsored reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( with exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ biz @-@ Un@@ cle and producer of keeping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest .
this poses the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we forgot you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a sen@@ ate place at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an has begun .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim may have beat her , as for the Vo@@ gue Cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for herself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference somewhat similar to a picture @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years images of the magazine fil@@ tered even before the official announcement .
women already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate M@@ oss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small probability that Ms J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success to everyone .
with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers was always somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the ein@@ sti@@ ge Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; the Mist@@ res@@ ses of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings were once again high , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but passing on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
Antonio J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her made pictures of Cin@@ dy CRA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal health centres annually exp@@ el 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid figures are reported annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry is focused on the impact of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five individuals - mostly older people , immigrants , ne@@ edy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and like - have rejected free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already considered exc@@ essi@@ vely , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the Director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell &apos;s Common Law Centr@@ es said that the last survey of the National Association of Common Law Schools resulted in thousands of people being rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only become worse without the federal government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal law centers are chronic under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ mount@@ able and overwhelming debts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismis@@ sed wron@@ g@@ ly - all these people have problems of legal kind and this survey shows that they cannot get the aid they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we urge the General Public Prosec@@ utor and the Defense Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these aver@@ ages so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their communities , and that Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ ction Camp@@ aig@@ n was indic@@ ted after co @-@ workers report@@ edly drew up arms
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after sharing her campaign manager for North Carolina in February , while she was on the way in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment , submitted on Wednesday in the County Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini had waited for months to have waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before federal elections : SPD and C@@ DU lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the governing party SPD and C@@ DU are notable .
these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could continue to go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were hes@@ it@@ ant again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag , despite slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his maker has experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cking .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for roughly two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to the stores exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the age of the internet age .
however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Computer Fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible using HTML browsers , al@@ beit slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be worked out like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was € 392 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even though not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division of Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ parall@@ eled disaster , was eventually sold and wound up to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates suppliers , all of which came much later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
there were about 1.4 billion devices sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million copies .
worldwide sales with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ running transactions of the countless app providers and the telecommunic@@ ation skon@@ ver@@ ne come from .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communication , easy to use by touch screen .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Executive Board responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered to be a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country bring renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as we did in London in 2012 , when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we already have 10,000 new teaching positions , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs create and youth unemployment in the airport environment will end .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had in@@ justice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked him .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not individual infrastructure projects .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in weather and a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz und Mouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse play &quot; are the same .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post , in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop site would change enco@@ ding with respect to its adverti@@ sements in order to make it more difficult to recognise the indication of which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams commented that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the an@@ tim@@ el@@ ating open source community and the trans@@ lators is already underway since the invention of scor@@ pi@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embar@@ ked on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying mark@@ ers have become for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide are using mark@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts 84 percent of Facebook ad revenue .
the company has no effect on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; ad pre@@ fabri@@ cation tool , &quot; in order to have more control over them than adverti@@ sed .
on Thursday , Facebook affir@@ med that block new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not adverti@@ sements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Facebook spokes@@ man in an email communications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a d@@ ull resource , which is why we instead focus on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman during pres@@ umed suicide over@@ ride Swiss Motor@@ way
the victim was lying on the highway at the middle of the night .
the police call upon witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway at an alleged suicide in the early morning hours on Thursday .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was transferred from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , told the police that promp@@ ted them as well as any witnesses to the incident .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a colli@@ sion avo@@ wed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases , in which a person in the dark ran on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running at the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of his negli@@ gent murder after passing a man and killed him who was at the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious on the street , took the court .
the court stated that the police -- who had responded to a call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police on number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 .
NA@@ SA Klim@@ amo@@ dell : Venus was once inhabit@@ able
the Venus was probably inhabit@@ able according to the projec@@ tions of a new NA@@ SA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NA@@ SA have developed a model to detect the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have revealed similar conditions .
scientists have earlier suggested that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect them from ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent we@@ aker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus gover@@ ns its day@@ side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution previously thought by planet researchers .
although it was formerly inhabited , Venus was exposed -- over the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by the ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy acts as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations from the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer I thought about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also needs to have a right to decide on decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy won the award as the best coach of the le@@ ague during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadian and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North des@@ ee@@ pers again engage in talks , put strike off &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labor struggles for the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all parties put themselves on the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to rest@@ art the process of wr@@ apping the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start early next year to rest@@ art the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shor@@ tened the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 % drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary space to get through the market down@@ swing .
shell has released thousands of people and plans to give up plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its m@@ ega @-@ gather@@ ings with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensi@@ fied by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are profiles of leading retailers , with analysis of their performance and the challenges they face .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star neck of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ er to understand why stars in the cluster are rot@@ ting at different rates and in which context the rot@@ ational periods are with the planetary creation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , created around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are turning to the fastest time now .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these gri@@ pping stars exp@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the occurrence of a recogni@@ zable star @-@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotating as smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas quicker rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars to slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the astronom@@ ical journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eb@@ all Star comes from
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ guez than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
following his emotional res@@ ign@@ ation , the 41 year old professional will be wearing the Tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 at the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year agreement has issued a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full capacity .
as a player it paid Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eb@@ all players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the rest @-@ hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which banned stero@@ ids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a winding in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main susp@@ ect for years to have received funding through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ are@@ well @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends win the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include any f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the ac@@ tress of Cameron Di@@ az and re@@ affir@@ med the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and ac@@ tress Kate Hudson , sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ ri@@ val Boston red so@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ eko@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing probe , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio cannot start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wis@@ p ath@@ l@@ ete almost won a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 metres ste@@ ep@@ le ste@@ ep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ eko@@ wa , Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and eliminated in Brazil - immediately before the on@@ set of the already cri@@ tically gro@@ omed athle@@ tics competitions .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de had already been detected last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked medium for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final about 100 m of butter@@ fly , only at 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the proceedings about 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
chen has requested the opening of the B @-@ Probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited Xin@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer is the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ eko@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the banned substance of the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ cost@@ wa has been suspended for the moment , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe has already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v contacted us immediately with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ contaminated nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z , three days earlier , positively tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both deny the intake , both of them must not start in class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes is especially the case Dan@@ eko@@ wa another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Federation had forbidden the whole Russian crew except for systematic dop@@ ings , even the le@@ f nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous adv@@ ancing in China also caused violent disputes between the athletes .
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to surrender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun has been positively tested with the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit a three @-@ month lock .

the perpet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially bo@@ ther@@ ing ran@@ som is considerably higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertisement .
then the perpet@@ rat@@ ors discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an victim , it searches for un@@ changing files like Word , Excel or database files , as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the requirements of the pres@@ ser .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
however , where private users the personal photo database is at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage is incur@@ red when a ran@@ som@@ ware is inf@@ licted .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay not , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in the face of stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chi@@ ppers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
they declare their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , direct support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files for free .
and will trigger private individuals after payments of a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from anti @-@ virus provider SOPH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is prob@@ able , however , that it is three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by buying the malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers are then looking for more h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the crimin@@ als carry sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are faced with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the potential for damages is much higher than before .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
at the hacker conference Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get their control connected to the Internet connected thermo@@ stat .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating might well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls apart .
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 453 l for up@@ set and 10@@ 26 l in the back@@ folded back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24@@ m high from the floor to the ceilings .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the equivalent Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel , with 88 kW / 120 hp , speeds up the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide revolutions .
he should do his job somewhat qui@@ eter though .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering may be somewhat more direct .
in the tested top version , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired .
the security systems are part of the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the colli@@ sion warning system and the lane assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colli@@ sion war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable is the remote @-@ beam assistant .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ ary respon@@ ds to the recognition of traffic signs and rot@@ ates the speed if necessary .
the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch tou@@ ch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and an HDMI connector lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 2@@ 9000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : down@@ fall to passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is only concei@@ vable with haz@@ ards that are typical of aviation .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the crash .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
case : when pays the organizer
after their trip , sick leave will only get money back when the cause of the illness is without doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family was severely affected by di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ steps .
it spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective se@@ wage treatment that suppos@@ edly so@@ iled the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip would have been defici@@ ent - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success before the court .
indeed , the se@@ wage treatment was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially since in the samples of water there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 691 guests were only 38 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must mind and decisi@@ vely react to terrorist haz@@ ards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of perpet@@ rat@@ ors with hatred and split . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , this increases the security and also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère proposes to implement proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another human ampli@@ fication of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four @-@ digit order of mag@@ nitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire can be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is more difficult .
the last much discussed silence of silence for doctors is to be maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a radi@@ c@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers better social care necessary .
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against shareholders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ per in the C@@ DU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a ban on Bur@@ ka and the aboli@@ tion of double nation@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general ban on full conce@@ al@@ ment is un@@ constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not possible to for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simul@@ ate a new anti @-@ terror p@@ act as well as capacity for action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet j@@ umps and shar@@ pen@@ ing of the right of stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it regularly sto@@ ws on the envel@@ ope - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal ab@@ norm@@ ality should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the environmental street every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway exit Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ turning lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then flow directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : traffic spl@@ its up early , thereby improving the total operating process on the busy passage of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the C@@ DU faction in the district council Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ ously anno@@ ys drivers between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here the traffic is only guided by a single lane through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt well into three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to take the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane above all .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will last , the relevant state business can not say .
however , it is possible to reck@@ on with years , because the bridge has an official resi@@ dual use until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the prolong@@ ation of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose the bu@@ oy@@ ant time in the school holidays because with disabilities it is to be expected .
the traffic will be passed on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enables young people with mig@@ rat@@ ory and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ sichtbare Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the Association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young@@ sters of the class were born between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video anim@@ ations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , from Spra@@ kel , and the Junge Theater will work together during the upcoming season as part of a theatre project .
from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the area of theat@@ rical play and theat@@ rical language examination are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ s@@ nu@@ ff : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night for Friday a grain of the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of Heaven , said the president of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of star@@ lets in the sky .
the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen are Persi@@ an , which belong to the fastest shooting stars with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is going on in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , one wal@@ lows etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep long before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disturb@@ ances and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or dur@@ ably than not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ schung and Schlaf@@ medizin .
what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , thus an entry and breakdown disturb@@ ance .
many people just feel sleep@@ y as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Haus@@ ärz@@ tin association with practice in the Lower Saxon Var@@ el .
what is behind in@@ som@@ nia ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
those who , for example , have a her@@ nia failure , can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ aking up every two to three hours and starts to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and wor@@ ries , We@@ eß provide an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I become a doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advis@@ es them .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , exhausted , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ aches .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to figure out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
the lo@@ wered sleep @-@ medi@@ ator hardly exists in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
that is why one should contact the GP in case of sleeping problems , so@@ ws We@@ eß .
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory disorders , in case of illness or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
one does not have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the c@@ abling , one goes into bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ g@@ og@@ gle , a chest strap and a ch@@ ick@@ le on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling draws up the sle@@ eper .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problem ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can sit for a better sleep .
We@@ eß counts on : regular dor@@ mit@@ ory and stop @-@ up times , not sleeping too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watching television for falling asleep , drinking alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ point the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the Doh@@ a short @-@ country champion@@ ships and at the same time presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler was faced by Facebook to protect his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his critic@@ isms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € premium and a jungle King 15@@ 0,000 € no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system in swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be maintained with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the W@@ ADA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election Hamburg , which meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de from Bag@@ gage Al@@ ley
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil Protection of the Düsseldorf police took on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had made several bags and baggage valves as gang .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport had a gang that was known to the police officers from the past thi@@ eves .
the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ik@@ es this year since mid @-@ July and were very professional , professional and very professional .
the specialists of the Krimin@@ al@@ kom@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove four acts , which have been submitted specifically for the investigation of criminal off@@ ences in Germany .
in doing so they had captured a total of more than 15,@@ 000 Euros .
old buildings , a couple of lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stones : the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not look like that , but the police ranks them at the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes the play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the facade of a grey house has bo@@ wed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which should soon be demoli@@ shed , it is already built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , will be illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents now have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel recorded several occasions for a hard police action against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled three weeks of official declar@@ ations with 30 to 40 officials and three cl@@ ub@@ teams on site , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the newly renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown pet owners have the premises .
on 13 July a Berlin administrative court ruled that clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others entert@@ ain vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * , who is attrac@@ ting three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern before rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted multi @-@ local police protection against v@@ andal@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police force between house @-@ owners and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses in the former G@@ DR were occupied , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer road close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are partly inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ers from all over the world : with them residents from DDR times and former house owners share their neighborhood .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on s@@ lic@@ ed discs or newly painted faç@@ ades , which were thrown with color bags .
no other road was mentioned so often this year together with the words &quot; Left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours could see it as a problem could be that they are not affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are reported almost exclusively to polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make material damage which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disp@@ uted 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not sure .
the famous burning cars are also no longer available in the Riga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal starting point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to the Riga @-@ Strasse - and remains .
that is why it was so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the truth about the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : thanks to sh@@ itt@@ y new buildings in former buildings , which displ@@ ace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ dos , which are not interesting for many - there are more people living here who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can absolutely not be thei@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you want to do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for those who are angry about color bombs Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belong to the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub that can badly compl@@ ain about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of management of Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine client from the Arbeitskreis indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ins@@ ati@@ fying wool mil@@ chs@@ au , which above all has a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , some - less mo@@ cking than aiming at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to leave the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
searched for was an administrative capacity with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ins@@ ati@@ fying wool mil@@ chs@@ au .
but administrative work is not the central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it concerns organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organisational , human and understanding problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; soon new containers stand in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ as@@ enst@@ raße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you must put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord is willing to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
until now , it does not work , whether on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be so@@ ber@@ ed as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be placed in the W@@ as@@ enst@@ raße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school places , one @-@ Euro jobs and job plac@@ ements for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people should develop a sense of belonging .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here are management and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to tell the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling at some point can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach should not work and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also problem cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who don &apos;t have anything at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is always also to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two of the most recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear radi@@ c@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins kill them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers need to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new kick of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors politics .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they need to help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ter wanted
the helicop@@ ter flew over an hour different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were pushed for@@ ci@@ bly into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the un@@ wind in flight .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 m tall , well m@@ asked , worn both Blue@@ jeans and black ho@@ o@@ ded pul@@ lis .
they fled towards the city centre .
for the prosecution , the police used several strikes and a police helicop@@ ter .
the ins@@ anity wasn &apos;t successful .
perhaps the unknown occurred near the apartment or when they fled .
