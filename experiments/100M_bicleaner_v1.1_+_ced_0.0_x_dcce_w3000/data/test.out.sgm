<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are on the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "trump wants to keep the doubts as small as the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively repay regulators, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it must be invested in that," "" "says Trump and Clinton almost word-like." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly denied by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "there could therefore be partisan discussions on trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>

<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but rather just protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should then be paid better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage does not need to be changed, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counteractor in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace in reception, I can't resist the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin smiles smalligly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan behaved as if something would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state did not forget Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow response to the time was outrageous.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin distributed and accused Ankara to be fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passing was even greater since it was made by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the vetrack will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a heavy, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria that are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan, primarily, needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed during the last month with a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-imperial rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the State television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued resentment on EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state in Ankara won a bonus for sure that after the attempted coup d "état, he called for support for the elected bodies of the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Moscow, this is a matter of course, a matter of course, which even has a deep anxiety over regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this brilliant palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an analyst, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that have fallen off from the west and are badly treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents spoke at the press conference that they didn't even seize the issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin chose to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin cheats Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's closest confidant.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed as a Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that without giving reasons" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs has ordered Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been appointed Ivanovs Substitute since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State University of Moscow for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it is said (in Russian) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Head of Staff of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Impress the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest colleagues and worked as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: it is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could say this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust to embarrassing post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been the Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close to Putin's allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closings to the" "" "deckle blowers" "", "which are nearing completion to approach each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10.000 tons of steel and 20.000 tonnes of concrete and 46 slant ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown once visited the building site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry cross dressings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering art of truly epic proportions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck in its place and the last section of the Decks get a ton for the deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is future-oriented up- and deep-construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the extension, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern Zubringerbrücke bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the viaduct is 222 metres long, about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A scheme is missing until now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD spokesman Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also be found in the stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the main issue in the town hall is, however, the Bratmann:" "" "how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors in such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing construction programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU aims to make investors a few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher constraints for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of the so-called "Bratmann," a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not entirely up-to-date: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one reconcile the loss of further 1,300 cheap apartments whose funding is going to run over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning olitical spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought off-running bonds from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to return apartments back to the pricing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one fell, the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Weststadt run at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the west city is increasing drastically again, one removes from the aim of so-called confusion.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social-weak in just a few districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go out to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and recently restricted to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created initially for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest in the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers were overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days Pokémon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found" "" "photographed" "" "(using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "" "captured" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person restores each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracking people who exercise 30 minutes each day, leaped 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to bring" "" "to take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "get active every day" "" "on deaf ears because many public messages about health are dull and coming from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miraculous at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even lock new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mürric game spoilers that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-camera Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American female Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish bar during the single multi-campaign period of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-kampfist title and the fifth, while consolidating her reputation, being the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that involve a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It anticipated her last examination in Brazil, a competition which was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans will hug Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, after they have won gold and silver in the single multi-campaign group of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, this is not really true.</seg>

<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since summer 2013, she has not lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>

<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when they expected her grandchild - a pure formality - and tears flocked on a bright red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present at the Women's Olympics in the gymnasium and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this squad, which is Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, which is Katholikin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, yet masterly Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual Americana, who won gold in an individual campaign for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnasiums across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to bring it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic Games will only have four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private trainers, which are maintained by parents responsible for training, furnishing, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnclubs are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their whole training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to make the municipalities aun numerous young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have offered free and affordable vacation gymnasts in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and coach national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of "Girl Power" by hitting the Olympic team and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes through the adoption of a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistants who voted for election were rejected.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt's plans were unveiled, forcibly introducing the treaty and said that the NHS had been found in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants should receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend work, in order to improve maintenance during idle times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committee for assistants last night in a message with: "assistant physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will incite the current workforce and will administer it, treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.</seg>

<seg id="10">If he does not do this, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further activities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved in granting medical doctors on the strikers chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA aims to provide better weekendremuneration for the 54.000 assistants who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS employees, urged the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Mortimer said:" "" "employment measures achieve nothing of the only little but already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient, peacocks and their families only concerns, distress and interruption." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">During the last two months, we talked to the committee of the assistants and responded positively to the concerns about the paternity and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility for training, additional training for those who come back from a vocational training, training course, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training vacancy and the Ministry of Health concerning the adherence to agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and throws a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk underwent his course on a Euro banknotes, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a knob of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prior to the emptying of each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title of "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaning the rinsing knob of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his darmes by traveling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task put its immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was in any case justified.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample score showed a luminescence number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminescence number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to leak after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial count at different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I have had in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">Here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus containing both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we launched crazy brainstorming that ended we said" "" "Let us call Ian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking just about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film director, added: "let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had raised some of the things I wanted to lick him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria were particularly associated with the well-being of gastrointestinal and intestines and 58 percent said they may at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asoziale family left their social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £50,000, because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been cast after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed flap holes, wooden boards were ripped, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said:" "" "it was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseballets, intimidations of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strikers and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will possibly be torn down, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">There were drugs traded in the estate where drugs were traded in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they faced them on the street and regularly had to invade the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner tremendously from the property after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation was cheered by lightened neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They didn't complain about anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have agreed with the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to whom the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the church home, garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant had agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogation is always the last step considering Cornwall housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and had to be horribly mitigated for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageous to us and have given us the information we have done.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will donate some neighbours and the message conveyed that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to clean garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine, after having found guilty of owning a drug of class B in commercial custody.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delogate tenants that don't stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants that do not stick to the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: the natives don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "2021 is not going to take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">For more stupidity than to date it is not: summer holidays, heat and land baldness - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the electoral champions, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, practical problems come: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count voices in the end can only be laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign to the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "your refugee policy, you" "" "We create that" "" "has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its nickname, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major media revelations; Merkel federal swath group lies in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats last at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD was still able to win 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day.</seg>

<seg id="8">This also applies to the development of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to furnishing behaviours.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved south on Monday and also the block of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village was relaxed.</seg>

<seg id="15">As also the speed limits were not met, the congregation reinforced the vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buy vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before heading to the comments section, to oversee him under the pseudonym of non-Allemist men of middle ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the revival of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and get wild, before I stop, hold my hands and say something determinate like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly shrinking in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These vinyl records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought would probably be too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vices.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets to meet the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also notices a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group, people who have heard about the comeback and get to see their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually have gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that plate shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects, the happy youth plaques.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector, and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff inspires from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month did not yet have listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably be very concerned, while I was leafing through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just came here recently and said," "" "I don't have any record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead soundboard so that I can put them on the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-oriented, less musicarious.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who are coming in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "stop, which has devoted the record to almost a whole floor, has a bumpy audience when I go in." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts neueste synthesizer- and sexgripping pop instead of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more than a shopping spree than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore the collection of records is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or another, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives off with a loving sighing.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I have the impression to mutate the jeans-pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers might send in the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that gives the most for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors in Soho, which exist in reality, record shops and online forums, are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday night with safety not with the strolling through records of Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while they avoid the stubborn look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, who overlooks nothing of middle-aged men across the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees are living.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary transactions in which individuals within the store sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, and which have a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important since the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>

<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the rains was the Jungle Book Kids "Café des Lagers, which is operated non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-th rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a masterclass in handling, side quilting, backs, line-up, and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiahdaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad trophy of silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the treks, 7-5 in semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it, Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every match at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks jumped from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners walked 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolorau overlooked at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A preeminent tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou squeezed by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB culminated fundamental changes in the half-time and closed the fijiic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was running for a long time in favor of the South seapsulators, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame made the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fiff sounds, the Fijis hugs and GB skillfully beaten in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scarce semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown led the boats to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team, secured the prize - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinous gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Pieve who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all-present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in a row without a tax-woman, the first women in the history of British sport that laid down such a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter unskilled use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets which glide over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind any gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one is lifting a coach than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago, if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already her entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the course of the apprenticeship, she took up the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy in the music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures solve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir:" "" "to speak and organise themselves, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, means hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Employment Agency of the Seniors organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awakes many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-affected people devise long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special achievement is also demanded, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone do so to concentrate not only on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir means hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I long for something, I will better and awoke beyond me - this experience boosts.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone wanting to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who is listening to a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">If you are looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniorboy, one can simply join in.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also Austrian citizens are still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities, such dumb.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, first exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thailänderin was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and according to the authorities another man was killed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also of Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation near the beach of tourists popular bathing beach Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police data.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded, which killed a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives went into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast also called for several wounded in the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to express themselves about possible motives - but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">Nor is it clear what group behind the attacks stalls.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police assigned their officials all over the country to reinforce security around important government buildings and airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but most of the time they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the weary bomb explosions, the Austrian State Department on his homepage recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">Conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations will not be abandoned in these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risks (security level 2) paid for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military big influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to stiff chaos while the country drifts towards stability, an improvement of economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, keeps himself very good to have led the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the insurrectionary of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest stroke of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say that it is unsensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat will allow some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unflowerable, self-propelled tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps arrive at the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accusing that the app would propagate Blackface conveyors or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and woken cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders, who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet over the photos were widespread, that the filter was "vulnerable and least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrasting of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filtering effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the gel-face has been drawn into the descending extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolperwire.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterplayers - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "if one of Snapchat filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "" "it's much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it was in the past," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to erase their Snapchat account for others to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="1">ISIS forfeits ISIS intelligence, sets the Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it had allowed the actual states to be present in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The provisional report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the armed forces, intelligence services and the defence budget, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence agents who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence information provided by high-level CentCom commanders regularly marked a positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on location were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," "" "quoted a newspaper article." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The principal errors in the CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed related problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct reference to the fact that government tops have given orders under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure of their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were much more positive than the facts" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it is so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command issues changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be supplemented with more detailed insight during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence is underway.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly limited process for the creation of post-intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "said the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the release of intelligence reports," "" "announced morals among analysts and" "" "gave too little space for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indications of intervening the White House at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, which were received after the complaints of CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave in an opinion that the ministry of defense would not comment on the congress, while the inspections of the inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also indicated that" "" "experts at times have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of the past year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honourable assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of disagreements of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a handpiece about how the former government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to specify government agencies that contrary to the statements of the government air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition has not been published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">Surrounded by the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">Events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed by the watchman to the swimmer to the gymnast to triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could have been quite under these familiar names that were broadcast to Prime Time, built by sponsors and good-good TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fencing.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade there are the sports that are not universally recognised: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I tend to make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event in Sydney since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so tenderly noticed that many of them, I had asked, did not know that it is an olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes for competition, there was never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it until the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never ending sensation - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports, which essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, hitting and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "you will be judged according to official" "" "official" "" "Olympias after execution, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in television transmission also another important goal: the world or the Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as something tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attacking and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his air-to-air, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shook the country and expanded to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people burst into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the response of the government was inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen shot and kill unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or early this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Committee is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terrorism outside the region, particularly in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at the remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations continued to suppress repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, where dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or jail, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and do not have any other options except protesting it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less constrained in recent years, exploited the turbulence and rearming itself again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness tend to explode after years of leuckle under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopia have been able to communicate with social media, since cheaper smartphones became more and more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so close to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two greatest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, thrived in the politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to co-ordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigray, who constitute about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death at a non-publicised disease in 2012, 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special appointees to manipulate enemies and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively short reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uprising in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which, according to analytics, were apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and that time of disturbances went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal grievances of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an amethian city, run by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently reported that it closed this base." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim to Obama that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday that killed his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification put new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his fellow combatants who strive to protect him during an eventful period of protection, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After finishing the announcement at an election rally on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump sums up his claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet Mr Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump would help to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prasselt down to Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return again to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had a strong criticism of himself when he thought the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course I thought the sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "according to how the reaction falls." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more etched note, because his surveys have declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll from NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he reinforces the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provoking his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned regarding Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called her backers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in Mrs. Clinton, served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread through the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania, on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of carrying on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps apologation as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with well a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of young talent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland-shark floats along the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle embossed lifestyle seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "at least of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this period of life, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist already suspected that Greenland is becoming a stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, finally they live above all in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow pentagons measured them when they were six animals with a transmitter at Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this shark anyway: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadavers that torch from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks who took fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen from Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest shark measured 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably plenty of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a weapon of nuclear arming greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of the smallest animal with 220 cm length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens nucleus, all major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-cm long Grönland shark, while the record shark was likely to be 392 years old at 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females first get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to order an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the reproduction apparently allow at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon at the neck took a 120 year old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on sparks.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gets lost.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were met.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romantic passage of all the ministries in two years, the Federal Council of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and we finally decided to go to the Bischofsstadt Freiburg, where this year was a special pilgrimage destination during the Holy Year of Mercy with the open gate of Charity in Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small party in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer's wife is standing and thus the pilgrimage route from Muenster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual daytrips were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even on the way, the Minis made their way to rock crosses, chapels, or churches in order to sing together a song consisting of specially arranged pilgrim songs.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays there were pastors of local parishes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast at the stage.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued our journey through Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, one entered the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to descend some 500 metres in the case of the sull heat and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the closing flap to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis met in Münster in the late afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert was greeted at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the worship the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>

<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner travelled to fame last night in the cycling team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen. the Jungspund made the legend proudly when he stormed his home to win a win from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London in March at the London Railway Championships in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as executions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner set up an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the ranks the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindes fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindes went to a higher gear to slow him down, and to enable him to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and dropped out Skinner, Kenny and Hindi when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round, we set up an Olympiarekord and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys site, there were indications that after a weak start, he was clearly on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later returned this statement and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a phenomenal victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We got so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next to the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will be in focus with safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he had argued with commissioners before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in puppy time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of Sexismus- and Mobbingvorfen and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached the perfect moment its climax, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is running out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa installation in Portland stand on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be jeopardized at closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium carpentry with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture owned by Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "AGL agreed that the value of the treaties was already written in its annual budget of $187 million in" "" "anticipation of a dismissal" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the Treaties, the "Ability Alcoas... to operate the smelting or to ensure the power supply to the smelting" does not impinge.</seg>

<seg id="6">This poses the stereotyped action nearly every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we forgot you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a senate place at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.</seg>

<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather knocking.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can buy the devices still on the internet, but they somehow come from the age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Computer Fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible using HTML browsers, albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be worked out like a laptop.</seg>

<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was €392.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could guess in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow is not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country bring renewal and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as we did in London in 2012, when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will achieve this by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities we already have 10,000 new teaching positions, 40,000 new jobs create and youth unemployment in the airport environment will end.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be such that will think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not individual infrastructure projects.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180.000 new jobs, £211 bn in weather and a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, until the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented catwalks of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a "cat and mouse play" are the same.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block display blockings on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post, in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop site would change encoding with respect to its advertisements in order to make it more difficult to recognise the indication of which part of the site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams commented that "this kind of hin-and-forth struggle between the antimelating open source community and the translators is already underway since the invention of scorpiers," and that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worrying markers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide are using markers worldwide; almost four times as much as 2013.</seg>

<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its "ad prefabrication tool," in order to have more control over them than advertised.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA have developed a model to detect the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have revealed similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have earlier suggested that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect them from evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus governs its dayside of the Sun for almost two months," "" "explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was formerly inhabited, Venus was exposed -- over the course of several billion years --too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping probe, weightlifters Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio cannot start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wisp athlete almost won a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000 metres steeple steeple in Silwia Danekowa, Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been positively tested and eliminated in Brazil - immediately before the onset of the already critically groomed athletics competitions.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had already been detected last Sunday, which is used as a masked medium for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final about 100 m of butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the proceedings about 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has requested the opening of the B-Probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and requires Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," "" "cited Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, no longer is the IOC, but the CAS for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the night of Rio the news spread over the positive rehearsal at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements," "" "explained the athletic." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to act in the banned substance of the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Dancostwa has been suspended for the moment, according to BNT, the B-Probe has already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov contacted us immediately with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-contaminated nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, like his brother Tomasz, three days earlier, positively tested on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, both of them must not start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes is especially the case Danekowa another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Federation had forbidden the whole Russian crew except for systematic dopings, even the lef nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the previous advancing in China also caused violent disputes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle, I want to surrender," "" "said Lacourt on the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "said this." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">(Deutsch) Datenklau: so perfide erpresses Hacker ihr Lösegeld</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers from blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>

<seg id="5">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially bothering ransom is considerably higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an victim, it searches for unchanging files like Word, Excel or database files, as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the requirements of the presser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users the personal photo database is at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is incurred when a ransomware is inflicted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "pay not, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The chippers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, direct support websites or decrypt free sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will trigger private individuals after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is probable, however, that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals carry spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on repel Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are faced with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the potential for damages is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get their control connected to the Internet connected thermostat.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating might well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a trunk of 453 l for upset and 1026 l in the backfolded backrests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1,24m high from the floor to the ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the equivalent Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel, with 88 kW / 120 hp, speeds up the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide revolutions.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should do his job somewhat quieter though.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering may be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the tested top version, the equipment leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems are part of the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable is the remote-beam assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporary responds to the recognition of traffic signs and rotates the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and an HDMI connector lie under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway bridge</seg>
<seg id="2">It regularly stows on the envelope - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal abnormality should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the environmental street every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway exit Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit Weseler Straße the right-turning lane by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then flow directly from the hammer road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: traffic splits up early, thereby improving the total operating process on the busy passage of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district council Münster-West.</seg>

<seg id="10">Weekdays from the back to the bridge over the Albersloher way and sometimes also beyond.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips for sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one wallows eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep long before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or durably than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafforschung and Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the insomnia, thus an entry and breakdown disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people just feel sleepy as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Hausärztin association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is most common in depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who, for example, have a hernia failure, can lie poorly, waking up every two to three hours and starts to pondering about everyday problems and worries, Weeß provide an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises them.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, exhausted, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to figure out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">The lowered sleep-mediator hardly exists in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should contact the GP in case of sleeping problems, sows Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise for example in snoring with respiratory disorders, in case of illness or if you don't find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling, one goes into bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggle, a chest strap and a chickle on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling draws up the sleeper.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problem?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular dormitory and stop-up times, not sleeping too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watching television for falling asleep, drinking alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's absolutely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming</seg>
<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler expressed himself on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he first picked up gold at the Doha short-country championships and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler was faced by Facebook to protect his ex-team-mates in front of his criticisms.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 €premium and a jungle King 150,000 €no one should be surprised about missing medals," "" "the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page at night on Friday." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The system in swimming sport is bad, the doping controls, on the other hand, very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at the topic of doping or even operate it." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls are to be set here," "" "he explained." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler had to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how it should be maintained with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "anyone who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the WADA / FINA must not take part," "" "the election Hamburg, which meanwhile operates an ice cream parlor." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">The suspects had made several bags and baggage valves as gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 p.m. civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport had a gang that was known to the police officers from the past thieves.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several delikes this year since mid-July and were very professional, professional and very professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Kriminalkommissariats 34 can prove four acts, which have been submitted specifically for the investigation of criminal offences in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In doing so they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of linden trees, in between still a rest of the cobblestones: the Rīga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like that, but the police ranks them at the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes the playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "the facade of a grey house has bowed" "" "ugly!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which should soon be demolished, it is already built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, will be illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the residents now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin inner senator Henkel recorded several occasions for a hard police action against the project, called the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were evacuated with 300 police officers, the police patrolled three weeks of official declarations with 30 to 40 officials and three clubteams on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the newly renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown pet owners have the premises.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin administrative court ruled that clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain vorm späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is attracting three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern before rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted multi-local police protection against vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin internal senator and the police force between house-owners and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, among them almost the entire Mainzer road close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are partly inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and ballers from all over the world: with them residents from DDR times and former house owners share their neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on sliced discs or newly painted façades, which were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned so often this year together with the words "Left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours could see it as a problem could be that they are not affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are reported almost exclusively to policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make material damage which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disputed 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not sure.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are also no longer available in the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the architect, her street is not a criminal starting point, on the contrary:" "" "here, one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved to the Riga-Strasse - and remains.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the truth about the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: thanks to shitty new buildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condos, which are not interesting for many - there are more people living here who are not so well drunk," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can absolutely not be theirs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you want to do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those who are angry about color bombs Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belong to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub that can badly complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client from the Arbeitskreis indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is there, the insatifying wool milchsau, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "so, some - less mocking than aiming at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to leave the place." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was an administrative capacity with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an insatifying wool milchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not the central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it concerns organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "soon new containers stand in the" "" "Wasenstraße" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Councillor to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord is willing to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it does not work, whether on private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be sobered as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, school places, one-Euro jobs and job placements for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here are management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to tell the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling at some point can't help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there is also problem cases," "" "says the client," "" "people who don't have anything at all." "" "therefore, the work of Deuschle and the customer is always also to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two of the most recent occurrences fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some people may call naive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins kill them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers need to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new kick of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "but when people are in need, they need to help them, both women agree." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
