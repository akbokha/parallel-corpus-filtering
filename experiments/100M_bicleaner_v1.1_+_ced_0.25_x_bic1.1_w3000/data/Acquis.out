in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained by the securing measures applied , offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
consultations on the organization , community or state are given consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes , an assessment of the Council after Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council shall be disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another of the organization , community , and states , to submit a party to an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states ren@@ ame two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four arbit@@ rators shall choose a fifth arbitr@@ ator .
if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbit@@ rators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure must be applied if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the affected countries .
a ) This agreement applies to non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract , and members of the association , in force , i ) when the concerned state of the organization notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention , and
II ) if the community of the organization notes that it is able to apply its security measures relating to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community , and the states consult each other upon request of one of the contracting parties over a change of this agreement .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This agreement enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force .
B ) This agreement will remain in force as long as the States are the contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures necessary to implement the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the procedures laid down in this agreement is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such de@@ bran@@ ce by the risk of premature discovery .
in order to reach the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , verbal integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the material quantity assigned for a certain period of time is specified with speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their verification , the organization makes full use of the community &apos;s security system after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material pursuant to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in applying its security measures , the community of de @-@ procedures and measures will make use of the following species and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more determined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the amounts of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed nuclear material and stock quantities ;
( B ) the evaluation of the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for evaluation of accum@@ ulations of un@@ measured inventory and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory and the changes of this stock for each material balance zone including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the code c ) , shares the quantity and composition of the material with , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is inserted into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to provisions in Article 11 , is temporarily not possible or desired , so consult the Organization and the Community about the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this agreement will be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures after this agreement , provided that the entire amount of material released in the states is at no longer free from these hed@@ ging measures than the entire material quantity delivered in the states .
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special plu@@ gg@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures after this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on the material .
the community meets with the organization complementary arrangements , which are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organisation according to this Convention , in the individual , as the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or modified without any amend@@ ment to the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organisation , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the Organization presents a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this agreement in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory by the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by common resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the goal of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the Mid@@ wi@@ ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
to this end , the Organisation of the E@@ EC presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special Trade Ac@@ coun@@ tants &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which accounts for the Member States in accordance with this Agreement and uses ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state to pay on request in the currency of the concerned state to order the transaction as administrator of the special transaction bank and to deposit at the deposit office of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any@@ one member state may make payments before the aforementioned dates .
the administrator takes about proportional draw on the cash or the tuition fees according to the usual procedures of the organization in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction bank in a reasonable manner .
in granting these loans , the ste@@ ward can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and predictable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms and conditions ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered to be considered as the objective of the addition to this agreement under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction cannot be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally considered by the organization granted for the organization ; thus , in ten free @-@ years , they are re@@ payable in 50 years .
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay these men &apos;s watch must be paid directly to the organisation they retain .
each special transaction loan is to be negotiated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
the proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and that according to what the administrator defined at the time the loan granted , recipients of a special transaction loan could be .
capital re@@ payments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction bank , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the administrator shall instruc@@ t the E@@ EC to complete all special transactions for the purpose of testing by the directors in preparation and on the projects and programs authorized by the directors .
during the period of re@@ payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker shall instruc@@ t the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expenses for this .
the administrator tran@@ sm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction accounts with a statement from the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account statement .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ EC tran@@ sm@@ its a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the special transaction bank .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the accounts recei@@ vable and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full issue of the funding account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction bank , the progress of programs or projects financed by special transactions , and above all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the E@@ EC and the Organisation have not entered into force , then the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be over@@ due with immediate effect .
if the total amount of capital paid by the recipient in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC pursuant to the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States will note the conclusion of the proceedings in question to the general sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Secretary @-@ General direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organisation .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding of which is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - HA@@ T en@@ acted the following RE@@ VER@@ N@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma metap@@ hysi@@ cs
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation is referred to as a Joint Company according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma metap@@ hysi@@ cs for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
because up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to comp@@ el their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement will enable every contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit by mer@@ ging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma metap@@ hysi@@ cs , and consequently the common objective of these research works , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electricity generation through use of the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or modified by the institutions mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties receive a new program , this will be replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association intended in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as laboratories which collaborate on the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
as part of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association set out in Article 2 of this Agreement , the Parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those who are called &quot; Association Organ@@ s , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland particip@@ ates with the time of entry into force of the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ s Exchange . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the joint venture J@@ ET with the time of entry into force of the present agreement , whose constitution it accepts .
furthermore Eur@@ atom cares for Switzerland to become contractual partners of any contract , whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the Association designated in Article 2 of the present Agreement shall be described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
in particular , the association agreement fores@@ ees the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , performs this task in relation to all research and development activities related to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the associated organs and al@@ ig@@ ns its T * activity in the interest of the two contracting parties to the common goal in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss program as well as to the common goal laid down in Article 1 of the present agreement . the scientific and technological developments in the world must be taken into consideration .
pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG shall ap@@ point one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are requested .
the Advisory Groups , which grant the VG research proposals with regard to the fact that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take this task as regards all research and development works which are referred to in this agreement .
as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the participating laboratories .
the Committee of Directors who supervis@@ es the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and who is responsible for the optimal use of the capacity of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , mer@@ ges this task with regard to all research and development activities that fall under the present agreement .
it provides in particular the best possible use of the personnel and the exchange of the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordination committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
the coordination committees , which provide the best possible use of the funds , the personnel and the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme , take this task in the respective area concerning all research and development works that fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is a representative of every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any third country affiliated to the core and energy research .
on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission on the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programmes and the definition of its total volume , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the area of the merger .
the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Gover@@ nor Committee , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Commit@@ tees have an advisory capacity .
the opinion of the VG to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties are working on the works of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland at the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is determined annually on an amount that represents the share of Eur@@ atom &apos;s quota at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the GDP of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year .
concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Joint Business as soon as this is established .
in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects the common company J@@ ET an amount which is defined in accordance with the financial provisions of the stat@@ ute of this common business .
the financial contribution to Eur@@ atom to finance the work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on human resources is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to the financing of the work carried out due to the corresponding contracts .
the Commission shares with the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover the expenditure in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the coming year .
the Federal Council will pay the commission due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .

- appropriate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and associated third countries in awar@@ ding contracts to carry out the two associated programs according to the principle of the best possible use of the amounts used .
the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma metap@@ hysi@@ cs will be communicated to Switzerland and individuals or companies that justify access to these knowledge under the same conditions as the Member States , persons or companies of Eur@@ atom .
the knowledge gained during the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the associated third countries as well as individuals or companies operating in a member state of Eur@@ atom or an associated third country research or production activities which justify access to these knowledge .
the parties shall share this knowledge to other states , persons or companies only if a deal is concluded between the parties , unless these individuals or companies operate in Switzerland research or production activities which justify access to these knowledge .
if the knowledge covered under section 1 and 2 of this article is protected by patents , these patents may be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and persons or companies resi@@ ding in the respective countries for research purposes in pursuit of the aims of this agreement .
the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and individuals or companies that are resident in the respective countries may be granted licenses or sub @-@ licenses to the use of these patents for industrial or commercial purposes , as far as the parties are authorised to grant such licenses or sub @-@ licenses .
the knowledge gained from the activities of Eur@@ atom , the associated organs and Switzerland prior to the entry into force of this agreement shall be made available to those states , persons or companies that are informed in Section 1 and 2 , as far as this is necessary for the use of the knowledge referred to in these figures .
patents , which are derived from the activities indicated in this section , are provided to those states , persons or companies that receive a license or sub @-@ license to the patents referred to in section 3 of this article , as far as this is required for the use of these licenses or sub @-@ licenses .

this agreement will be concluded for the duration of the Eur@@ atom programme mentioned in Article 1 ; it will be tac@@ itly extended in accordance with further relevant programme resolutions of Eur@@ atom .
if such a further program resolution goes , the extension for the duration of the new programme , which occurs at the place of the Eur@@ atom programme listed in App@@ endi@@ x I , is considered not to be termin@@ ated if it only comes to delays in the adoption of another Eur@@ atom programme .
before each decision on the acceptance of a new Eur@@ atom programme , the contracting parties are consul@@ ted within the framework of the organs of the present agreement in the articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time , subject to a six @-@ month deadline .
in the form of a correspondence to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in order to also simplify the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the event of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it appears further , in the agreement , to record an article 12 .
I encourage you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and suggest to you as an appointment for the entry into force on January 1 , 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your current writing with the following wor@@ ding :
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when the banks submit a corresponding request .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery charges of member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are called , to which the BI@@ S would be ready .
with every stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , but without a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as for the possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of one month after termination of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would be made in the currencies available to the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those transactions made by the BI@@ S at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .

in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount agreed in fact does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the traditional proposal forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement shall consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under No. 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes advantage of the protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to the Community market governed by this agreement does not affect the community market .
in case the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount stated under number 2 according to the extent of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
import loads for these new Member States are defined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the ho@@ ech@@ less rate of exhaus@@ tion is taken into account .
the total quantity mentioned in number 2 is fixed with the date of the accession of Greece to the Community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community takes everything to avoid a market development that could compromise the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the community market within the agreed quantities .

any contracting party may termin@@ ate this Convention in compliance with a deadline of one year by indicating the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in a manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions must not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated th@@ inning of the re@@ agent to be analyzed twice in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated only in the volume of the blood @-@ body fl@@ ushing in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as incomplete Anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at present standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in single preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating sti@@ ckers , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te fl@@ ushing .
the ti@@ ter gives di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the release of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International standard preparation or a state standards preparation in international units ( See Bulletin , O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative review of the International standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents listed on the label is based on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation trials ; it is to be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , if the agent continues to have the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ plen@@ ished serum .
re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ birth , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement is reached via a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all stages and controls of the re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all issued re@@ agents can be stored for a long time from the laboratory until with some probability it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to reinforce the effectiveness and preservation of the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their effective attack .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
a black on white printed label can be attached to each individual container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed to re@@ plen@@ ish ,
furthermore , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed to re@@ plen@@ ish ,
each consi@@ gn@@ ment shall be accompanied by a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with the anne@@ x to this protocol .

in THE assignment that the community has decided to strengthen the internal market within the Programme of Action on 1 January 1988 , in the internal Community trade , to introduce a unified management paper ,
in DER discretion , that it is appropriate to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , and between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a single administrative document ,
in DER discretion , that this agreement should not be interpreted in such a way as to un@@ tie the parties from their obligations arising from other international agreements ,
in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a unified management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a single standard paper ) is introduced , which is to be used without prejudi@@ ce to the nature and origin of the goods for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipment procedure ( herein@@ after referred to as herein@@ after referred to as dispatch method ) .
the form@@ alities associated with goods traffic between the contracting parties are provided by a single api@@ ary , for which prints are to be used in Anne@@ x I to this agreement .
depending on the case , the single paper is used as a registration or paper for export , shipping or import@@ ation .
