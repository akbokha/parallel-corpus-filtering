<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62, the Organization presents a summarized inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this agreement in the States, regardless of its origin, and continues to carry out this inventory by the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by common resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the goal of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement, and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the Midwities to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the Organisation of the EEC presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">"" "the organization establishes a special account under the name" "" "Special Trade Accountants" "", "which accounts for the Member States in accordance with this Agreement and uses (in this capacity the organization is referred to as" "" "Administrator" "" "), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest debits of the member state to pay on request in the currency of the concerned state to order the transaction as administrator of the special transaction bank and to deposit at the deposit office of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment is made in two installments (i) the first at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon;</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Anyone member state may make payments before the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">The administrator takes about proportional draw on the cash or the tuition fees according to the usual procedures of the organization in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction bank in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In granting these loans, the steward can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and predictable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms and conditions; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development program or project (including a sectoral plan), regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered to be considered as the objective of the addition to this agreement under the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction cannot be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which has already been approved by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts to pay these men's watch must be paid directly to the organisation they retain.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan is to be negotiated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expenditures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and that according to what the administrator defined at the time the loan granted, recipients of a special transaction loan could be.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction bank, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator shall instruct the EEC to complete all special transactions for the purpose of testing by the directors in preparation and on the projects and programs authorized by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of repayment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker shall instruct the EEC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expenses for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction accounts with a statement from the external auditors of the organization to this account statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker of the EEC transmits a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the special transaction bank.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid from the accounts receivable and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are apparent.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator until the full issue of the funding account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction bank, the progress of programs or projects financed by special transactions, and above all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, the EEC and the Organisation have not entered into force, then the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be overdue with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital paid by the recipient in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is repaid and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
