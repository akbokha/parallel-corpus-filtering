this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ y mind and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic peak tuning ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the fusion tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter , works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to a year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased anxiety associated with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to absorb ( absor@@ bs ) .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly more significantly reducing the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies than placebo .
in addition , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for intake ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled sugar ) , tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nausea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes applied to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hypo@@ fol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occ@@ uring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy showed signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be treated with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions associated with conv@@ ul@@ sions .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes Mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ sm .
considering the common gift of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
after using the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected to increase the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show any significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ysts / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ysts ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data layer for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies of the animal , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole accounted for a generally lower incidence of EPS ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study , over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ ton@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients was found under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , which had potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters , did not reveal any significant medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phase kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older Dem@@ enti@@ a patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no death sequence .
although there is no information on the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ F and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 of the respon@@ dents who adher@@ ed to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sum@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than in Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ton@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and an accounting effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , which were partially unable to respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ism is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average el@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia do not show any gender @-@ dependent effects .
a non @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal clin@@ ically significant differences concerning eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which was 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30@@ mg of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ solu@@ bility .
for rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ ton@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared to intake with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which was 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
for rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be termin@@ ated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy &apos;s enam@@ el tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
in case a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with respect to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hypo@@ fol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occ@@ uring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS include high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to the subsequent administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects were administered intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly in healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) and who simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
after using the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were received intra@@ muscular , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after all@@ a gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects in clinical trials ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients was found under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , which had potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters , did not reveal any significant medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and conv@@ ul@@ sions , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older Dem@@ enti@@ a patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements in agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 of the respon@@ dents who adher@@ ed to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery as@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than in Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( or@@ ally ) group and 57 % inferior to placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ton@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks , followed by a 74 week extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time up to reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration of a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity of intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; thus , they have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel medicines .
if only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time and worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
it must also not be applied to patients who breast @-@ breast cancer or have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately in the blood before the treatment begins .
the CH@@ MP committee noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and that it does not have to be given to other drugs in contrast to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel in order to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to transfer Abra@@ x@@ ane to the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease has failed and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neu@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage arrangements in patients with mild to moderate liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose modifications in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel again .
patients should not be treated with renewed abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles until the number of neur@@ ons increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count rose to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly marked cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardi@@ al incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to witness no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment with sperm conservation , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic efficiency and the ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects included in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasional : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

pain in the thor@@ ac@@ ic wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , back pain , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , muscular pains , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , there are no estimates of the actual frequency and no caus@@ al relationship has been established with these events .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bial agent that promotes the formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ating protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two in@@ filtr@@ ated studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer for 30 minutes .
this multi@@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel within 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour trans@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ meditation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural progression of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft @-@ line integration of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared to an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and to two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine separation was 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available to patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light for 8 hours .
Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into an abra@@ x@@ ane gas bottle .

member states must ensure that the holder of hom@@ olog@@ ation for the placing on the market takes care of medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . • With clear picture of the correct use of the product , venti@@ l@@ ated boxes for transport through the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood iron values in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter for adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients with chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby dimin@@ ish the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference doctor .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to bot@@ tom@@ stre@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the onset of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ et@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were switched to se@@ amed have been kept to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed cannot be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection below the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union the evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures bot@@ tom@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG an approval for the placing of se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood flow rate ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in one patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be tried in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ability .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and - sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be tried in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ability .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest legal dose required to control an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te figure increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline value , the dose should be kept up to 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te figure increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme starts , so that large iron reserves are available before the aut@@ olog@@ ous treatment begins .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA according to months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with an increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liters or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the plat@@ el@@ ets and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if there is no other reason for loss of action , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA is considered .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evidence of coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 .
according to the time available , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , is not acceler@@ ating the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who need to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 of treating patients with chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tical an@@ emia ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
for patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated appropriately before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins did not prove that patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F for hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral bleeding , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ angi@@ ogenic events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
independent of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treatment , th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations .
the genetically determined epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and identical in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of native patients .
with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells it could be shown that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of obtaining a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels that are reached after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

prior to the market launch and under agreement with the relevant authorities of member states , the holder of the marketing authorization must provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging .
the holder of the marketing authorisation holder has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and implemented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is set up and functional before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is used in the transport .
the holder of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ ko@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan and additional measures relating to pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , as in version 5 of the risk management plan specified in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the Au@@ thor@@ isation Application , is obliged to carry out the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Human@@ use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information , the impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan or the measures to reduce risk of risk • within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mile@@ stones
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment , if you suffer from an unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of coron@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) .
you suffer from severe isch@@ emia of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can increase within the normal range to a light dose dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ forms in further treatment .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with se@@ amed prior to the treatment .
after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported very rarely .
in case you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting , it will break your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia will be treated best .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of having problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying .
in case of increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the time available , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , is not acceler@@ ating the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for judging the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of coron@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there have been th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events in the past ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
in case you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour .
if you have a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , Ab@@ se@@ amed will investigate and treat the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of treatment .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood c@@ lot formation after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / employ other medicines or have recently taken / apply it even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may order certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia is responding to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally big inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia addresses the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered from a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms that arise in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with tears ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) again norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw@@ s .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a licence for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package bite • Con@@ tra @-@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
for patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the use of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A can adaptation is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and juven@@ iles Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data on safety and efficacy is missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D prior to the onset of therapy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of co@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates to an appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental implants , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and be based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the use of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of pre@@ atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as a severe side @-@ effect was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 out of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dys@@ functions that were associated as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum levels ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were 2.3 % of those treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Pa@@ get studies .
all patients additionally received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ och@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been broad@@ ly reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ op@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients based on tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with a patient with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric ed@@ dy frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ ac@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta revealed a lasting effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radi@@ us compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ased bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , th@@ read@@ ed neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology at 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volumes compared to placebo and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone reconstruction markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in the serum were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study periods .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all time points compared to placebo treatment .
compared to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the total amount and by 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not subject to the weekly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at relative to the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moder@@ ately severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( average serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.6 x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to ing@@ es@@ tion of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily for 2 months was evi@@ den@@ ced in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was achieved at 141 of the patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma gas rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β -@@ 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long el@@ min@@ ation phase with a terminal exclusion period t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body clearing is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the incub@@ ation period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al cle@@ men@@ cy of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 g / min ) .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid requires .
for severe kidney dys@@ functions ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C are 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was determined by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
long @-@ term studies with repeated use of accumulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure were toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the growth phase of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was marked with 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum levels of calcium .

risk Management Plan The holder of the licensing agreement obli@@ ges the studies and additional activities related to pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance carried out in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application and all following by the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the present statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached .
z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is created un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forcing the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / employ other medicines or have recently taken / apply it even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals that are known to damage the kidneys .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you are worried that you will receive enough liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion to a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood after the in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
when the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , immediately contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the ensu@@ ing in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have gotten Ac@@ la@@ sta .

persistent pain and / or cur@@ ative wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported especially in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects not listed in this user information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients have to be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients undergoing di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of co@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate supply of calcium , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion .

compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or that are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more
in addition , there were four studies involving more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking compared to a placebo .
on the other hand , studies on hi@@ ring smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of am@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess on this field of application .
the most common A@@ compli@@ a side effects reported during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients .
caution is advised when using levels of drugs such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the efficacy of compli@@ a with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who require it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive Diseases or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - apart from obesity - do not have any noticeable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other close relatives are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the recur@@ rence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice when these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and due to accompanying metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) . NG On evaluating side effects , the following frequency characteristics are :
very often ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä
only slight symptoms were observed in a toler@@ ability study in which a limited number of individuals were given disposable income of up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .

the percentage of patients with a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference between the mean weight change between the 20 mg and the placebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction .
the steady state plasma gas levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28@@ ,@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ tr@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) .

patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ her@@ ical analysis ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of adverse events which were not observed in clinical studies but which were observed in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area were considered potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , but not in all cases , the onset of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initi@@ als effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post @-@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in the learning behaviour or memory .

abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not shown .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily set in the highest toler@@ able dose alone .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the treatment except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapie was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of acet@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea was 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , while the additional dose of placebo caused a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who additionally took placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ i@@ ology ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or one of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in cases where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a licence for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and on one side the markings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
there are no data available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac safety .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be controlled as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ build complaints , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on should be continued , should be guided by clinical assessment by the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with a fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or as two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin is the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with chemotherapy compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment must be stopped ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interaction have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ cide ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in a 3 @-@ fold increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the hyper@@ insulin resistance in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , rare cases : unknown ( from this data cannot be estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege on the triple of the upper limit of the standard range also performed frequently on as under placebo , but less rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the frequency of severe con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency was rarely reported in Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to have an activation of specific recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it has been shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is delayed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimisation with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or placebo .
in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those receiving insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone was observed .
in clinical studies more than one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week investigation of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced the total plasma @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids in comparison with placebo , Met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , while dimin@@ ished values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced not only the ni@@ pple tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized into groups that received either Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is resor@@ bed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy is roughly the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ cide ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ actively developed pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ ces ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimin@@ atory time of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all of the active metaboli@@ tes is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume doubled with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on the hyper@@ insulin resistance arising in the gest@@ ation reduces the mat@@ ernal insulin resistance and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tumors .

the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with chemotherapy compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) .
in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d respectively .
in clinical trials more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced not only the ni@@ pple tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both via an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride concentrations as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane caused a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced in a similar way to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list of packages ) .
the CH@@ MP committee concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh the risks of treating diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day , if rapid initial action along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the inj@@ ections needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar settings have improved significantly due to intensified insulin therapy may be affected by hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to bring the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients after other medications taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral in@@ feed of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1,@@ 0 mg ) or by glucose which is administered intraven@@ ously by the physician .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum amount is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption of the resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of split@@ ting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect particular dangers for humans .

this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
the most effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human@@ ely ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology :

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two kinds of insulin are bl@@ ended , the amount of insulin quickly acting must first be re@@ wound , and then the amount of insulin produced .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to bring the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration point - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection point Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1,@@ 0 mg ) or by glucose which is administered intraven@@ ously by the physician .
clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id induced normal blood sugar ( 4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum amount is achieved within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of action is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with acet@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml Insul@@ in human in the in@@ fusion liquid 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ Glu@@ cose and 10 % D@@ - Glu@@ cose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature .

this can happen : if you are inj@@ ecting too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you are more than otherwise physically demanding
always set the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let ready @-@ to @-@ use pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the rubber membrane with a medical swa@@ b • Use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective bottle from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • Rem@@ ove the protective flap just and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Dra@@ g the large outer cap of the injection na@@ del and the inner cap of the injection na@@ del .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure proper dosage : • Hold Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • knock a few times with your finger lightly against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will collect the cartridge around one click in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • While the injection na@@ del continues to show up , press the button completely in ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must leak out of the tip of the injection needle .
• Pu@@ t the cap back to the finished pen so that the digit is 0 opposite the met@@ ering mark ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the push button is fully inserted .
if the push button can &apos;t move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves outward , while you rotate the cap • The scale under the push button ( push button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Noti@@ fy the highest number you can see on the press scale • add the two numbers to receive the prescribed dose . if you have set a wrong dose , simply rotate the cap forward or reverse until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push @-@ button is at the bottom and you feel a resist@@ or then take the cap off and put it back in such a way that the 0 of the met@@ ering mark is opposite .
make sure to press the pressure button only during the injection • Hold down the pressure button after the injection until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
you may not set a dose which is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge . you can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pla@@ ster@@ oids ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. greater urine crystal deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still higher than 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , there are still some cases of pla@@ ster@@ work ; it is therefore recommended that patients take additional medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ovi@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ o@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ o@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ovi@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the CH@@ MP committee found that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but it could also have a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present at present and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum pole contains still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 - 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ tra Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see paragraph 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous drugs , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the treatment phase because the lowering of the serum pole cone first mobili@@ ses ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases will rise so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the onset of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ che treatment and in the course of the clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ ope did not conduct interactions with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( an in@@ hibition of the metaboli@@ sation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , simultaneous offering of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg twice daily with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , dela@@ ying the intake of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy Information about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not be related to side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ kler@@ otic disease and / or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
adverse events reported during long @-@ term follow @-@ up studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally .

there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum levels in patients regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , resulting in less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ ong , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the pla@@ ster@@ d no@@ des by month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ ie / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received long @-@ term extension studies in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is observed , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage drop in serum acid concentration as far as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant via the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those used exclusively for al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicate that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same as that which is needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , di@@ ar@@ rhea , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( abdom@@ en ) as well as acid up@@ take .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components .
it must not be applied in cases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for placing AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE on the whole of the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of oste@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , should be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some of them were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms which indicate possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to consult the medicine for symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or a new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn of the medicine and seek medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue after the occurrence of symptoms which point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rarely reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens were predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available which indicate whether the reduction of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a max@@ illary surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is relevant for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um @-@ calcium received up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , oil sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies the average asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day were 8.@@ 8 % on the spine compared to placebo , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo was 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
it consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ings and two hours before adding a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily divided into soft tissues after an intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substances were eliminated within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and is therefore not thought to affect the elimination of other drugs by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of the gift of radio@@ actively developed vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy subjects , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as well as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , using Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter follow @-@ up studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t have been carried out and investigated how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with advance , as the advance dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose modifications must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus floor mirrors should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks of adjustment .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ts .
careful and repeated inspections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus surface mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate vicinity of the night .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear substance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not permit oral consumption in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dose recommendations - ren@@ al transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adap@@ tations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from twice daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this conversion has to take place in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplantation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment should commen@@ ce with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are being converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients ( although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal transplan@@ ts ) , received a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for patients with p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow levels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ern@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to adv@@ agra@@ f when switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the bottom level of the blood exceeds 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in the first time after liver transplantation , usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the retard@@ ated formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
no clinical data is available for the retard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f to prevent gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t receivers and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , ocular or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy which can therefore also occur under adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid pressure and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes by suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) should be present .
because Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is impaired .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive actions must be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients show no indication that in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ alkal@@ ine ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly determined because of the patient &apos;s basic disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects listed below are very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases as known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are frequently increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with advance .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumors were reported in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zable .
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ te protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um @-@ dependent blocking of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , furthermore the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 treatment plan@@ ed patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after a col@@ on transplan@@ t , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the major studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , oral study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus there were 21.@@ 7 % of cases in the gen@@ esis of bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
pancre@@ as transplantation A multi@@ center trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t , which were random@@ ised to receive a random@@ ized procedure ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
col@@ on transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids shall be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this indicates that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out via the bile .
the systematic exposition of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( once a day ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .

advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( due to the lack of factor VI@@ II conditioned , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into which it enables the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
advocate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under 6 years , the use of the drug was investigated to prevent ble@@ ed@@ ings and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ is@@ o@@ ds with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit to transport lawyers across the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II defect , the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment process , appropriate determination of the Factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to Factor VI@@ II , several in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma does not reach or if the bleeding is not controlled with adequate dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low@@ - ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s showed an inhibit@@ or against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 145 children and adults 2 with more severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE .
in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical study 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated patients inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ ous gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions during the study .

the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
for this reason , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , and has decided to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited was officially approved by the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ umes its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breasts , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumours and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein again .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is formed from the un@@ broken p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who performed Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ structure , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings advantages for the patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not adequately proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can cause con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ ra@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for the treatment of allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from con@@ genital glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ha@@ ge ) or a stroke of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms subsi@@ dis@@ ed .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after reduction of swelling of mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after such treatment .
this is attributable to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which can be performed per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ al as ab@@ u@@ sive Rhin@@ ology drug ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ in , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data is insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be stopped in case of hypertension or a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) .
patients with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not give rise to the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies of animals can not always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible tablets .
headaches , anxiety , fatigue syndrome , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ a cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ Selec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in one single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg demonstrated no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep depen@@ dency or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage may cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the plasma administration .
after the oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equ@@ ilibri@@ a of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical multi @-@ dose @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ certain gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to a dose of an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ ent@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbit in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the Au@@ thor@@ isation Application described Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance System is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drinking or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for inser@@ tion ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by identifying symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ gan@@ ing , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ ses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ ra@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents between 12 and 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current disease progression and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms subsi@@ dis@@ ed and can be resum@@ ed after returning the symptoms .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not strengthened while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headaches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ a cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ selection on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , which was administered over 14 days in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg demonstrated no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep depen@@ dency or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the load caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a representative of other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of eti@@ ology , is similar in different forms and can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited to chronic patients .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , which is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies more than 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant applications after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose case study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not depend on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ ent@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ ent@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical ab@@ norm@@ alities , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and learn a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metaboli@@ zed is identical to that in children that are normal metaboli@@ se .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , which is why patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not strengthened while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment were given a daily supplement of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents aged 14 days in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents did not have an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not interfere with the psych@@ om@@ otor system .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance was neither increased nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies more than 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restric@@ tive metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ally half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance cou@@ plings after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In several single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of per@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with recommended doses , with those of adults who received dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .

there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents between 12 and 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is taken without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dosage , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to the intake formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in one single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg demonstrated no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep depen@@ dency or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly metaboli@@ sing phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients aged 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined for pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ fin@@ ing studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of per@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metaboli@@ zed is identical to that in children that are normal metaboli@@ se .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol , which is why patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged 6 to 11 for a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
at recommended doses , plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents did not have an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ ig@@ ns its application for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against the flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
following administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign @-@ alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane envelope of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a foreign body ) is separated , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , as@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution for taking up , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ a should only be decre@@ ed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines have previously been taken by the patient , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , as@@ gener@@ a reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS should not cure , however , it can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the use of low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but as@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , as@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine used with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r lowered the viral load according to 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load was reduced after four weeks together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of aging ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
as@@ gener@@ a may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are broken down as well as as@@ gener@@ a and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take as@@ gener@@ a are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the CH@@ MP committee concluded that the benefits of aging in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were predomin@@ ant over four years compared to the risks .
as@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of am@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was originally granted under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the placing of as@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union .
as@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children aged 4 years .
usually A@@ gener@@ a capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for aspir@@ in capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r two times daily together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If as@@ gener@@ a capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of rite avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for am@@ on@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of am@@ per@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that as@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with previously restricted h@@ ep@@ atic function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the active ingredient concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , as@@ gener@@ a can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ lic content of the as@@ gener@@ a solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
as@@ gener@@ a should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many patients had other diseases associated with medicines that were associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic wid@@ ths are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic wid@@ ths A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose agents are mainly metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the reduced plasma level by a dose @-@ increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % reduced if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended for a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine is recommended , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ i@@ dic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the proceeds of di@@ dan@@ o@@ in and as@@ gener@@ a lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , with the gift of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if this medicine is used together , caution must be taken ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ pha@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ pha@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ pha@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ a , at least half of the recommended dose will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with am@@ n@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in increasing the C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may interact if they are used together with as@@ gener@@ a .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs when used in combination with am@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ a as it can cause resor@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme reduc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to degradation of the plasma gas of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with as@@ gener@@ a can increase their plasma concentrations considerably and strengthen associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , fluor@@ es@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of as@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected while administ@@ ering as@@ gener@@ a .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased concur@@ rent with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with or@@ ally bi@@ ased Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while caution is required while using as@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the very low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adapt the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for concur@@ rent as@@ gener@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mig@@ rates into breast milk .
a reproduction study on vi@@ le rats administered by the im@@ plantation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most adverse events associated with aging were mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , early on and rarely led to abor@@ tion .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the seizure of as@@ gener@@ a or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and vaginal fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ de@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ ern@@ ack ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients were treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice daily together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception were increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values which were received very frequently in patients who received A@@ gener@@ a together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is aware of signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary support measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein levels with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both on acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r stained @-@ in treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 included patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( isol@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally untreated patients demonstrating a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early onset of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect the subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
the receipt of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial , in which P@@ PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) were treated with a PI , predominantly with low dose k@@ night avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ e- and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average variable from bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ submission threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ blocked aspir@@ ation is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of age , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , as@@ gener@@ a solution was used to intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low d@@ osed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with as@@ gener@@ a .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ is should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the average duration ( t@@ 100 ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration at the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affected the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active portion is likely to remain unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration at the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a medium of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with aspir@@ ation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of as@@ gener@@ a capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio @-@ bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ el &apos;s solution and aspir@@ ation capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dys@@ functions should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma gau@@ ges similar to those that are achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r two times a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas appeared in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence suggest@@ ing a clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to humans , were observed in a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate a delayed development .
24 If as@@ gener@@ a capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of rite avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for am@@ on@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the active ingredient concentration are available .
aging should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended for a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
if this medicine is used together , caution must be taken ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ pha@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ a , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended for a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , fluor@@ es@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a reduction in AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study on vi@@ le rats administered by the im@@ plantation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is aware of signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary support measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both on acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ gener@@ is should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration at the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a medium of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with aspir@@ ation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dys@@ functions should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas comp@@ lied with the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence suggest@@ ing a clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests involving bacterial reverse mutation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that the metaboli@@ sation path@@ ways are not fully developed in young animals , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
as@@ gener@@ a solution for intake is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ oi@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ a solution for intake was not documented in patients with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , because there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a solution for intake and low dose k@@ night avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ a solution for intake in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , as@@ gener@@ a solution for infants and children under 4 years of age is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be noted that as@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ a , does not prevent HIV from trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the active ingredient concentration are available .
as@@ gener@@ a should be set in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with as@@ gener@@ a can increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are expected to significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk to humans is not known . a generic solution for intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the propylene gly@@ co@@ l contained in the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mig@@ rates into breast milk .
a reproduction study on vi@@ le rats administered by the im@@ plantation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the seizure of as@@ gener@@ a or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r stained @-@ in treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
early departure of a se@@ eding 60 treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can have a detri@@ mental effect on the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ is should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .

important information on certain other components of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for taking The solution to intake contains propylene gly@@ co@@ l which can lead to side effects in high doses .
propylene gly@@ co@@ l can cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also as@@ gener@@ a must not be taken , special caution when taking ast@@ er@@ ase is necessary precau@@ tions ) .
if you forgot the intake of as@@ then@@ ase , take it as soon as you remember it and then continue the intake as before .
headaches , fatigue , diar@@ rho@@ ea , feeling of illness , vom@@ iting , flat@@ ul@@ ence skin rash ( redness , bli@@ stering or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash can be serious nature and force you to ab@@ ort this medicine .
this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , fat gain on the abdom@@ en and other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat blo@@ cker in the neck ( &quot; sti@@ cking &quot; ) .
the other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polye@@ thylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , To@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( T@@ P@@ GS ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial chew@@ ing gum , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate D@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water .
the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses , it is applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted thin layer on the affected areas of the skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies involving 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete tumour healing after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total ab@@ lation rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic or hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible asc@@ ents have disappeared in the genital or periodi@@ c area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the treated les@@ ions were completely healed during follow @-@ up examinations 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and must be submitted in the puri@@ fied , infected skin areas until the cream is completely dra@@ ined .
in these patients it should take place between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients it should take place between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ co@@ gnition was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with the circumc@@ ision leading to the circumc@@ ision .
when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties with ur@@ ination , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been present for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other sub@@ cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external wrinkl@@ es in the genital and peri@@ anal@@ ges@@ ic area .
although limited data suggests an increased rate of suscep@@ tible reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown lower efficacy in this group of patients regarding the elimination of cow@@ ards .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair rate was not examined .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during the therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapies should be considered with super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experiences are present , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tumors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less likel@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on anatom@@ ical points outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions have reduced the total treatment rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) go out of animal studies .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were obtained after a non @-@ recurring topical application , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly shared and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the hands war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial were shown below .
the most common one , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to the side effect , were in these studies a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials involving I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials involving three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ ori@@ ation / un@@ rest ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often lead to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe gra@@ ding and scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony which norm@@ alized following oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete recovery of the hands in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of the patients treated 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients healed completely ; this was the case at 20 % of the patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time use per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic active les@@ ions within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external suscep@@ ti@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ fic@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drug in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat doses ranging from 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg to significantly lowered body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months revealed no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the application area .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a minor systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk to humans due to systemic exposure is considered very low .
the tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need medication before administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years old , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed for more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary if necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in response to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. company to transfer Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect related to the in@@ fusion or the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alization devices for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are likely to form within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , it must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
pre @-@ treatment 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ka ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen must be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular inclusion of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , which include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath still@@ s and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe follow @-@ up and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a serum conversion was performed within 3 months after the onset of the treatment , with a more severe follow @-@ up form within a month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early withdrawal from the study ) , no investig@@ able antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom there was never ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larvae activity in vitro , which did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ go @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy was the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute housing test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and hearing , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased in proportion to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease @-@ manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expect@@ ant percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , movement range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted to examine the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe tra@@ vers@@ al form and 4 with mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg due to increased levels of G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were noted after the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no advances in the cognitive development were determined .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG @-@ mirrors in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect particular dangers for humans .

this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural pro@@ g@@ nosis of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that sp@@ li@@ ts certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking pharmaceuticals that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies as single therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given .
in patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose can be decreased .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin experienced an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the single dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies patients , in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , showed longer survival times in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved by 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - C@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ single @-@ cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1,000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ etry , a complete blood picture should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose check must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , taking account of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be termin@@ ated if in patients with 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ osi@@ tives , an ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased risk of side effects in patients aged 65 years or older than 65 years of age .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min there was no need for dose adap@@ tations that go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or tran@@ sm@@ ine values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for the occurrence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients have to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ chan@@ gels again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count and maximal non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in the preceding cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ chro@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for which a P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy is prescribed , should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
for patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment should be advised to seek advice regarding the sperm conservation .
high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of increased re@@ occurrence of side effects .
caution must be taken if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed .
the major in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit to the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to seek advice regarding the sperm conservation .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of patients who received random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mono@@ therapies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .

for this table , a 5 % threshold of 5 % was specified for the recording of all events in which the reporting physician held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( commonly ) of patients who received random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed included :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ed c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in hospital studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
in clinical studies patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment were occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis , and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment , in cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , patients were reported from clinical studies .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ sep@@ tic that breaks its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ dable metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ at with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ sy@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically meaningful survival compared to those patients who were treated only with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the patient arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in relation to the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ in@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with prior chemotherapy showed medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ medi@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.@@ 0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
middle PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow , without compromising the quality of the pro@@ - duc@@ tive quality .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who are taking all i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the diet , thereby making about a quarter of the fats that are fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received 4@@ 60 mg after one year reported an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of all i ( observed for more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on the anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ cco , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish of o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must not be applied to patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a licence for the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes is accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic medicine may need to be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional precau@@ tionary measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
a reduction in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are linked to the pharmac@@ ological action of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to com@@ promises with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in most cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human and animal studies , it is possible to proceed from a rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ tic properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect prev@@ ails in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper bow@@ el by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ tic lips .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at is taken three times a day , which blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value of 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable for 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) without signs of accumulation .
two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ oni@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after split@@ ting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) , were identified in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ em potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .
pharmac@@ ko@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system The holder of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as described in the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , will be applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 and older with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ calorie diet .
BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight or overweight relative to your body size .
even if these diseases don &apos;t cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for a check @-@ up .
for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose during a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines which have a blood @-@ th@@ inning effect .
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of or@@ ally @-@ increasing means of contrac@@ eption ( contrac@@ ep@@ tive pill ) may be weakened or lifted when you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhea ) .
if you are taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for the treatment of cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and • if you take drugs against high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted .
for more helpful information on the blue pages in Section 6 , see how you can define your calorie and fat outer borders .
if you leave a meal or eat a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk food @-@ related side effects ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to your new eating habits , start your first capsule intake with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet .
nutritional tissues are effective as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your eating habits .
to achieve your target weight safely , you should specify two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Nutrition to help reduce dietary factors ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active during the intake and after the seizure of all@@ i .
• If you cannot find any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of use of all@@ i , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .

the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : • Begin a few days , or better a week before the first intake of the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Store drug for children in@@ accessible . • Do not use all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the box • Do not store over 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers containing silicon , which serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate dis@@ sol@@ vers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding an additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regi@@ mens , which are strong and moderate causes of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chemotherapy , the moderate dis@@ sol@@ ation for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison to Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection should be closely monitored .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with simultaneous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi will not be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ cle@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) were reported ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be associated with Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy in an al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time period of 4 hours ) or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron received intraven@@ ous day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption After intraven@@ ous administration followed an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ally half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are propor@@ tionally proportional to the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following an intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average plasma concentration of 11 testi@@ cular cancer patients was measured between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once a daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0,@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was compared to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time release of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and about 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes , which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies of metaboli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection in healthy patients the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver disorders have severe liver dysfunction and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies there was evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of the action .
high doses pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equivalent to the 30@@ x of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the approval of the authorisation for the placing of the medicinal products intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue is damaged , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon has presented data that demonstrate the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference point of reference to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were vo@@ iced to ensure that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease again fl@@ ared with more patients than with the reference doctor ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sten@@ osis ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mary , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ man@@ ia may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged 9 months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together on skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ ge@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been prov@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the sur@@ facing point .
the CH@@ MP committee concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small fir@@ s , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. an authorisation for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation due to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection can be begun .
retin@@ ol should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ os@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on poor skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity according to oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the effects of birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
if the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman should be weighed .
in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the date of delivery , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s ab@@ lation of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggests that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and preventing normal formation of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of retin@@ ol should appear question@@ able at least some forms of infection , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ os@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % retin@@ os@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and sc@@ ented skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of trau@@ matic trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 with the adult patients prior to medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metaboli@@ sm The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive functioning of the liver and thy@@ roid .
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rat micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats evidence of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ eg skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected .

for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ isation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan that is made out of two doses can be completed .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hepatitis A or B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines act by helping the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can fight against disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix has the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ines registered since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ head adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations to hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in six months and a 12 month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain in the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals approval to the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardis@@ ation plan for the pri@@ mor@@ dial portfolio with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully secured , if immuno@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a re@@ fres@@ her as protection , as they may also be protected by the immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , adequate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the primary dim@@ pression , so that in these cases the gift of additional doses can be required .
since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously in thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems , since in these cases it can lead to bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection using a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there is possibly no sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , fatigue , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination factor .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ urities on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of subjects who had administered Ambi@@ rix were suffering from pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of matrix was comparable to each pro@@ band ( i.e. about the overall vacc@@ ination cycle in 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to those observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that which was observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the age of 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vaccine that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in infants aged 1 to 15 years , the dose rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose administered for the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
for the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 , after the 3 @-@ dose dy@@ e was administered with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vaccine received either a 2 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to those that were detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month vacc@@ ination scheme in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the re@@ fres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ um per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after resor@@ ting to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
pursuant to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state char@@ itable sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by means of viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as swimming in waters contaminated by water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not completely protect from infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus even if the full vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before administration of both V@@ acc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix , ( although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent illness .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest itself by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child will take additional medicines ( including those you could get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or has been given or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ was very common ( more than 1 case per 10 de@@ pressed cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the inser@@ tion point or redness • Respon@@ sibility • Rei@@ z@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 mixed cans ) : swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal complaints
other side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B , are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 blocked doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the issu@@ ance of the initial approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
in patients aged over a month , ammon@@ ia can be used in pre @-@ history with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
Ammon@@ ia is - distributed on several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a stom@@ a stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of the leading hose ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach of the leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , as Ammon@@ ola could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo agent , i.e. without active substance ) .
in addition , ammon@@ ia can lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste sa@@ dition , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , too high ammon@@ ia levels were effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved , because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information was given to this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication exists for the use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy occurs in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of car@@ gos@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ sy@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , as there is a risk for the orig@@ ination of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablet contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ ing of the neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events had assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
one case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ ju@@ gated through acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ o@@ dium , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
morph@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ o@@ dium is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram @-@ bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ o@@ ag@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga during the first year of its life .
hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e defect ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and treated thereafter permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ o@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined after an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in healthy adults and patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes was also investigated in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected in 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations .
in most cases , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after different doses ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma gas were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ glut@@ amine .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no negative effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gar@@ net is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets , or patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups ) or via a stom@@ a stom@@ a or a nose probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of car@@ gos@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat aid was exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ te of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , les@@ ions were found in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
morph@@ omet@@ rically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a similar ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ ting excess
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ o@@ dium glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , taken for each gram , is produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ o@@ dium glut@@ amine .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ule form , plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were found 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can retain the finished product only once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring sco@@ op of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the drug over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body .
when laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for instance for unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stem up@@ lift . &quot;
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) and compared to conventional combined treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient was frequently used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days and one year as much as conventional treatment .
in patients with a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in with regard to all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ira , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the CH@@ MP committee concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve angi@@ ox marketing throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further consequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after clinical need , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
an intake of 0.5 mg / kg is required immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous induc@@ ing of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion at a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single cap@@ us @-@ administration of angi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the stu@@ ds have to be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given properly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , it is possible to admini@@ ster a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second one .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 Pati@@ ents with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis are contra@@ indicated by angi@@ ox ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ agulation disorders . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when they are administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of hem@@ i@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sions occur in PCI patients , most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion may occur in patients undergoing acute coron@@ ary ar@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( PCI ) during treatment .
for patients receiving War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is again achieved prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant mechanism ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ry with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters must be checked regularly .
the animal experimental studies are inadequate with regard to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira group and the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were significantly less frequent than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occur@@ ren@@ ces : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 4 g / dl without apparent bleeding , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasional ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ori@@ u@@ din at 6000 patients who have undergone a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira group and the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above were reported in practice according to a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed by system organ@@ ists in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ira is immediately broken down and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ira , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion @-@ bark@@ ing region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn on its part slowly cle@@ aves the attachment of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
moreover , by using serum @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction was induced .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ira demonstrates a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was subsequently performed in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ira was given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery was increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed across the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography in 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require a treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra becomes sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ osis is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin levels was observed after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ osis or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ to@@ id muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose generation capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
any change in the active strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the type of insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can lead to a change in the insulin requirement .
3 A insufficient dose or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
switching from a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment is changed .
among the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the effects of symp@@ athetic agents such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reservoir can be weakened or absent from the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c an@@ tigen regulation .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ osis and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral treatment .
listed in the following are the un@@ desirable medications known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ ists and ordered according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to continuously switch the injection site within the injection area , can occur in the following a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ c@@ tival inj@@ ections , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ tin the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than in the case of hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ on@@ tus , insulin lu@@ li@@ osis in the therapeu@@ tically relevant met@@ ering range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ ity , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ enk@@ escent effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ tin has twice as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ enk@@ escent effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
when insulin lu@@ li@@ tin was served two minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given two minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ tin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mixes before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) , is reached .
insulin lu@@ li@@ tin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ tin in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to humane normal mal@@ low , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
