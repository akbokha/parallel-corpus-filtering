<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR) which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiry mind and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexic peak tuning) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased anxiety or behavioural disorders, if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or the fusion tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole probably works mainly as" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter, works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">Efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased anxiety associated with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to absorb (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly more significantly reducing the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled sugar), tremor (tremor), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients with predominantly manic episodes, and in which manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and their manic episodes applied to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, hypofolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occuring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify showed signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be treated with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at conditions associated with convulsions.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes Mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After using the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected to increase the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole did not show any significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethysts / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omebozol) and 3A4 (Dextromethysts).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data layer for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies of the animal, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole accounted for a generally lower incidence of EPS (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study, over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with Olantonine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients was found under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, which had potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters, did not reveal any significant medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phase kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older Dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or deliberate overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing as Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HTF and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">A dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and on the puttest, performed in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 of the respondents who adhered to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assum- depression rate scale, showed a significantly greater improvement than in Haloperdol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olantonin controlled, multinational double-blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and an accounting effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which were partially unable to respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study for over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyylation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyism is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elmination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did pharmacokinetic patients with schizophrenia do not show any gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A non-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal clinically significant differences concerning ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Cholelithiasis was also detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (which was 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose or 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30mg of the sulfate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">For rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of the 3 and 11-fold of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used for fast control of agility and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once clinically appropriate, treatment with Aripiprazole injection solution should be terminated and commenced with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimize the variability, an injection in the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acut therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify's enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">In case a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepins is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with respect to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, hypofolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occuring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS include high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating, and cardiac arrhythmias).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to the subsequent administration of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy subjects were administered intramuscularly in healthy subjects Aripiprazole (15 mg dosage) and who simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison with CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After using the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were received intramuscular, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after alla gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects in clinical trials (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients was found under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, which had potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters, did not reveal any significant medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and convulsions, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older Dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agility / behavioural disorders compared with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline value on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 of the respondents who adhered to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly greater improvement than in Haloperdol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (orally) group and 57% inferior to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olantonin controlled, multinational double-blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for over 26 weeks, followed by a 74 week extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% greater in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time up to reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration of a systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on the reproductive toxicity of intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; thus, they have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (10-fold of the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Cholelithiasis was also detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time and worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be applied to patients who breast-breast cancer or have low neutrophilately in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The CHMP committee noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given to other drugs in contrast to other paclitaxel in order to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited to transfer Abraxane to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first-line therapy for metastatic disease has failed and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neuropenia (neutrophilately &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy degrees 3, treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2, and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage arrangements in patients with mild to moderate liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies have been carried out with patients with impaired renal function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose modifications in patients with impairment of kidney function (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel that could have significantly different pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">Patients should not be treated with renewed abraxane treatment cycles until the number of neurons increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte count rose to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly marked cardiotoxicity was not proven with Abraxane, cardial incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there is nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients after the treatment of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied in pregnant women or in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to witness no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment with sperm conservation, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (frequent) that can affect the traffic efficiency and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects included in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (in 79% of patients reported) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the use of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasional: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thoracic wall, weakness of musculature, back pain, pain in the skeletal musculature, muscular pains, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Rest 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, there are no estimates of the actual frequency and no causal relationship has been established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrobial agent that promotes the formation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminreceptor and due to the albuminating protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two infiltrated studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer for 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel within 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour transfusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without premeditation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural progression of peripheral neuropathy to decay on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure exposure exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft-line integration of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-Gabe (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">Published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers is reported that Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urine separation was 4% of the total total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light for 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packaging. • With clear picture of the correct use of the product, ventilated boxes for transport through the patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same ingredient (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood iron values in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter for adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be controlled before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients with chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby diminish the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the course of a major study with 479 patients who suffered from anaemia caused by kidney problems, Abseamed was compared to the reference doctor.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to bottomstreamed or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the onset of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of streetamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were switched to seamed have been kept to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed cannot be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection below the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that for Abseamed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union the evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures bottomamed will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG an approval for the placing of seamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood flow rate (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In order to reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be applied to a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which can not participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the doctor's evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed in one patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">The hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) should be tried in view of this hemoglobin ability.</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.E. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and - sequelae may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the doctor's evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required.</seg>
<seg id="396">The hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) should be tried in view of this hemoglobin ability.</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest legal dose required to control anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the haemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulozyte figure increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline value, the dose should be kept up to 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulozyte figure increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the hemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Retikulozyte number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, Abseamed should receive a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation programme starts, so that large iron reserves are available before the autologous treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the tube of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with any erythropoetin in a erythroblastomy (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or other erythropoietin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recent heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an antibody-mediated PRCA according to months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction in hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with an increased need for transfusions, the Retikulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxicity, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the "index"), is degraded (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliters or &lt; 0.5%), the platelets and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if there is no other reason for loss of action, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for the diagnosis of a PRCA is considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the gift of epoetins if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control anemia symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidence of coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the time available, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, is not accelerating the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa treatment and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who need to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a b-value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 of treating patients with chemotherapeutical anemia).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">For patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be investigated and treated appropriately before the onset of epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist for patients with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins did not prove that patients with symptomatic anaemia improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7,5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">There are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF for hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebrovascular events (cerebral bleeding, cerebral infarction), transitory ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, aneurysm, retinalthrombosis, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that builds bone substance) again normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 from 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted Novartis Europharm Limited a licence for the transport of Aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The package bite • Contra-indication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">For patients with low-traumatic hip fracture, Aclasta's infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget Morbus, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Paget Morbus with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the use of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunctions (see Section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A can adaptation is not necessary, since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and juveniles Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, since data on safety and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D prior to the onset of therapy (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of cooledron acid on bone conversion, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bisphosphonates to an appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental implants, no data is available, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and be based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the use of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of preatrial fibrillation reported as a severe side-effect was increased (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 from 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunctions Zoledron acid was associated with kidney dysfunctions that were associated as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum levels) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change of the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatine within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium values that were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were 2.3% of those treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients additionally received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study in the study on preventing clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but most patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteochonecrosis in the jaw area has been broadly reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteopekrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients based on tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area with a patient with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or intravenous calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric eddy fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Acacsta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebrate fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures Aclasta revealed a lasting effect over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures in one by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebraic acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increased bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, threaded neck by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology at 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic ridge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volumes compared to placebo and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone reconstruction markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in the serum were determined in subgroups from 517 to 1,246 patients in periods of study periods.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5-mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline value and was kept at 28% below the baseline value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all time points compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% on the total amount and by 4.3% on the Schenkelhals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized, and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta was not subject to the weekly dose of alendronat relative to the percentage change in lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderately severe Morbus Paget of the bone (average serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.6 x to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value for the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg zoledron acid compared to ingestion of 30 mg of Risedronat once daily for 2 months was evidenced in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with aclasta and 107 with Risedron patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was achieved at 141 of the patients treated with aclasta, compared with 71 of the patients treated with Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma gas rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long period of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β -1.87 hours, followed by a long elmination phase with a terminal exclusion period t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearing is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the incubation period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clemency of zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin clearing, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 g / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the zoledron acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">For severe kidney dysfunctions (creatin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on AUC are 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use, the renal tolerability of zoledron acid in rats was determined by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">Long-term studies with repeated use of accumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure were toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the growth phase of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was marked with 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum levels of calcium.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron acid is a representative of a substance class called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Morbus Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens produced from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is created unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing bone reconstruction, ensuring normal bone formation and reinforcing the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / employ other medicines or have recently taken / apply it even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is particularly important to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR) which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients), metformin can not be satisfactorily set in the highest tolerable dose alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the treatment except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapie was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c), indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of an additional dose of acetin and a sulfonylurea was 0.94% reduction in HbA1c, while the additional dose of placebo caused a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, the patients who received Actos in addition to insulin had a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in cases where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a licence for the placing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and on one side the markings" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">There are no data available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of congestive heart failure by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac safety.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to 3 times the limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be controlled as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overbuild complaints, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazon should be continued, should be guided by clinical assessment by the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven, which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and haematocrit (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrit by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or as two-way combination therapy with insulin is the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under treatment with thiazoldindions, including Pioglitazon, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with chemotherapy compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years).</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment must be stopped (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interaction have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrocide (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in a 3-fold increase in the AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazon, the hyperinsulin resistance in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, rare cases: unknown (from this data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon ALT-Anstiege on the triple of the upper limit of the standard range also performed frequently on as under placebo, but less rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe congestive heart failure was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, insufficiency was rarely reported in Pioglitazon, but more often when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive trial running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ), leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It has been shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is delayed (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimisation with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazon, the average HbA1c reduced by 0.45% compared to those receiving insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies more than one year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week investigation of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol level as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasma-glycerides and free fatty acids in comparison with placebo, Metformin or Gliclazid and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while diminished values were observed under metformin and gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon reduced not only the nipple triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups that received either Pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application Pioglitazon is resorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy is roughly the triple of the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrocide (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactively developed pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the Fäces (55%) and a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma eliminatory time of immutable pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and all of the active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume doubled with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulin resistance arising in the gestation reduces the maternal insulin resistance and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazoldindions led to an increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with chemotherapy compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years).</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid respectively.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials more than 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon reduced not only the nipple triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this both via an effect on Tryglyceride concentrations as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane caused a decrease in the HbA1c mirror suggesting that blood sugar levels have been reduced in a similar way to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of actraphane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the full list of packages).</seg>
<seg id="869">The CHMP committee concluded that the benefits of actraphane were outweigh the risks of treating diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S a permit for the placing of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day, if rapid initial action along with a longer lasting effect is desired.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycaemia can be treated by the oral infeed of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness are treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1,0 mg) or by glucose which is administered intravenously by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum amount is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption of the resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of splitting (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebrate by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption to an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women 0,64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nightly fastings and two hours before adding a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% if Alendronat was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, Alendronat was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not lead to any clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronat (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies have shown that alendronat is temporarily divided into soft tissues after an intravenous dose of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly redistributed in the bones or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-alendronate, about 50% of the radioactive substances were eliminated within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the fences.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Following intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal Clearance of Alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, Alendronat is not excreted via the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys, and is therefore not thought to affect the elimination of other drugs by these transport systems.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Resorption In healthy adult subjects (women and men) according to the gift of ADROVANCE after nightly fastand two hours before the intake of a meal the average surface was below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 296.4 ng • h / ml (without taking into consideration endogenous vitamin D3 levels).</seg>
<seg id="1333">The average maximum concentration in serum (CMAx) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng / ml and the median time until reaching the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1334">Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly metabolized to 25-hydroxyprovitamin D3 in the liver and then metabolized to 1.25-Dihydroxyprovitamin D3, the biologically active form.</seg>
<seg id="1335">Excretion In the case of the gift of radioactively developed vitamin D3 to healthy subjects, the average excretion of radioactivity in the urine was 2.4% in the urine after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate, which is not deposited in the bone, is quickly excreted via the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is available, it is still expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as well as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, in patients with reduced kidney function, a slightly increased cumulation of alendronate in the bone is expected (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, using Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter follow-up studies of 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant have been carried out and investigated how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose modifications must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level provisions (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus floor mirrors should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks of adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus surface mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advagraf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate vicinity of the night.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a low-clear substance, an adaptation of the Adagraf-Dosisschemas can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application For suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression has to be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - renal transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advagraf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adaptations can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from twice daily doses of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Prograf capsules, so this conversion has to take place in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a change from other immunosuppressant drugs to Advagraf once a day, the treatment should commence with the oral initialdose recommended in kidney and liver transplant for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are being converted to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients (although there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplants), received a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, for patients with pankreast transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow levels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum levels, a calculation of the creatinincernance and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to advagraf when switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases under the aid of thoroughbred Tacrolimus-Talking controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus test levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adaptation, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or at the same time using substances that could change the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the bottom level of the blood exceeds 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, tacrolimus, in the first time after liver transplantation, usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under tight control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data is available for the retardated formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data is available for the retardant formulation Advagraf to prevent graft rejection in adult heart transplant receivers and transplant recipients in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is to be avoided during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, ocular or septum hypertrophie was observed under Prograf as cardiomyopathy which can therefore also occur under advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid pressure and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes by suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, show symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g) should be present.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Because Advagraf contains hard capsules, retardized, lactose, special caution is required in patients with the rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations accordingly (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is impaired.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearing of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, decisions on contraceptive actions must be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that tacrolimus potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients show no indication that in tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of Nephropathy and JC-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advance.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors were reported in combination with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyzable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by binding to a cytosolite protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent blocking of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on the T-helper cells, furthermore the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection rate was 32,6% in the first 24 weeks in the advance group (N = 237) and 29.3% in the Prograf group (N = 234).</seg>
<seg id="1473">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90.8% for Prograf; 25 (14 women, 11 men) and prograf arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) were killed.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, at 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97,5% for prograf; 10 (3 women, 7 men) and prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) were killed.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared in combination with Basiliximab, MMF and corticosteroids, 638 de novo renal transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of treatment failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf- Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In the Advagraf arm 3 (men), in prograf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 women, 3 men) death cases occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily applied Prograf capsules according to other primary organ transplants Prograf has become a recognised primary immunosuppressant for pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 treatment planed patients, in 475 patients undergoing pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases after a colon transplant, were used as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies was consistent with the major studies in which prograf was used in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, oral study with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients were reported, who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus there were 21.7% of cases in the genesis of bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans- syndroms in patients treated with tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas transplantation A multicenter trial with oral Prograf was performed on 205 patients who underwent a pancreatic and kidney transplant, which were randomised to receive a randomized procedure (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (by protocol) of tacrolimus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colon transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric trial with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant after transplants showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional gift of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus, which lead to valley mirrors (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematocrit value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids shall be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This indicates that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly carried out via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systematic exposition of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients (once a day) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus test levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (due to the lack of factor VIII conditioned, congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether advocates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into which it enables the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under 6 years, the use of the drug was investigated to prevent bleedings and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepisods with "excellent" and "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit to transport lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII defect, the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma level (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, appropriate determination of the Factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to Factor VIII, several in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma does not reach or if the bleeding is not controlled with adequate dose, a test must be carried out to detect an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be based on the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the prooagulatory activity of Factor VIII immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-days and anamnestic known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs showed an inhibitor against Factor VIII (5 patients) who showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels performed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with more severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed low inhibitors (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days with ADVATE.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, a FVIII inhibitor was found in none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical study 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell proteins, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were reported on the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophilous granulocytes in several repeated product expositions during the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As for other intravenous products, ADVATE has reported hypersensitivity reactions of allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid responses (frequency unknown).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated factor VIII acts as a factor factor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">For this reason, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's security profile, which necessitates filing of PSURs every 6 months, and has decided to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited was officially approved by the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) that the Company resumes its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breasts, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumours and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53-protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein, which is formed from the unbroken p53 gene in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who performed Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of substructure, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers of the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial documents submitted, the CHMP will create a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings advantages for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not adequately proven that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or "compassionate use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and older, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can cause constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerosaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerosaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active agents or Lorraadin (other medicines for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from congenital glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertonia (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrohage) or a stroke of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms subsidised.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After reduction of swelling of mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, treatment can be continued with Desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, dihydrogotamine or other deongestiva, which can be performed perorally or nasal as abusive Rhinology drug (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrin, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data is insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be stopped in case of hypertension or a tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is deprecated at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistaminika otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with Desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and placebo-treated patients regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in-vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies did not give rise to the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies of animals can not always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, fatigue syndrome, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil stiffness and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human maca cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of expression of the adhesion smolecules P-Selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In one single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg demonstrated no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleep dependency or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage may cause further likeable effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosa swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets did not show any significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the plasma administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the oral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equilibria of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetical multi-dose-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were badly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the allcertain gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure to a dose of an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot detect particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Lorentadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbit in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for insertion (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by identifying symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadriganing, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilises the syrup, the solution for inserting and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">Allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Lorraadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of disloratadin in adolescents between 12 and 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the current disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms subsidised and can be resumed after returning the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not strengthened while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to lightheadedness, which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of disloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human maca cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of expression of the adhesion smolecules P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses, which was administered over 14 days in a dosage of up to 20 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg demonstrated no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleep dependency or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the load caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically Idiopathic Urticaria was investigated as a representative of other forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of etiology, is similar in different forms and can be easily prospectively recruited to chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causative factor in all urticellular diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, Desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of urticaria, which is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies more than 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and lowering the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not respond to antihistaminika were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient demographics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant applications after a daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose case study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not depend on the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with Desloratadin and Lorentadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Lorentadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot detect particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colorless film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical abnormalities, anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the Company resigns its application for the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against the flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">Following administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign-alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane envelope of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a foreign body) is separated, purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, asgenera is available as a solution for taking up, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenera should only be decreed if the doctor has examined which antiviral medicines have previously been taken by the patient, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenera depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, asgenera reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS should not cure, however, it can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Asgenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The use of low-dose knight avir was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but asgenera was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, asgenera also reduced the viral load, but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine used with Ritonavir lowered the viral load according to 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, the viral load was reduced after four weeks together with Ritonavir compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of aging (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenera may not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines which are broken down as well as asgenera and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take asgenera are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The CHMP committee concluded that the benefits of aging in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children previously treated with protease inhibitors were predominant over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenera is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of amgenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "asgenerase was originally granted under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "since only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of asgenera in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Asgenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -previously treated adults and children aged 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenera capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% lower than amprenavir as capsule; therefore, asgenera capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for aspirin capsules is 600 mg amprenavir two times daily together with 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If asgenera capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of rite avir (booster), higher doses of asgenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for amonase capsules amounts to 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenera in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of amperase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenera must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that asgenera or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asgenerase, does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously restricted hepatic function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of asgenera and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of asgenera with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended for the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the active ingredient concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, asgenera can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolic content of the asgenera solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asgenera should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many patients had other diseases associated with medicines that were associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hammophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding, including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial aetiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic widths are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width, and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic widths Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be used together with medicines whose agents are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the reduced plasma level by a dose-increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for CMAx reduced by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% reduced if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg konavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg konavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of konavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended for a close-meshed monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A pharmacokinetic study on the use of asgenera in combination with Didanosine is recommended, however, due to the antaidic component of Didanosine it is recommended that the proceeds of didanoin and asgenera lie at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, with the gift of Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin may lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine is used together, caution must be taken; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Riphautin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Riphautin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Riphautin together with asgenera, at least half of the recommended dose will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with amnase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in increasing the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may interact if they are used together with asgenera.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs when used in combination with amgenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as asgenera as it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva, known as enzyme reductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to degradation of the plasma gas of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingesting with asgenera can increase their plasma concentrations considerably and strengthen associated side effects with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, fluorescasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of asgenera with Ritonavir together with these glucococorticoids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected while administering asgenera.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased concurrent with amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenera must not be used together with orally biased Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while caution is required while using asgenera with parenteral Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the very low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adapt the amprenavirus dose when amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous offering of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with asgenera, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is recommended for concurrent asgenera (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactating rats, but it is not known whether amprenavir migrates into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on vile rats administered by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period of amprenavir showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asgenera was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with aging were mild to moderately pronounced, early on and rarely led to abortion.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are in connection with the seizure of asgenera or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of asgenera twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed at more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and vaginal fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsodevical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stiernack) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients were treated with Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderately pronounced, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of asgenera twice daily together with low dose kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception were increases in triglycerides and CPK values which were received very frequently in patients who received Agenera together with low dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is aware of signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein levels with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both on acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) by Amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir stained-in treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretrovirally untreated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolate of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 included patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, I84V, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinical validated phenotypic analysis systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (isolating points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretrovirally untreated patients demonstrating a resistance against Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early onset of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can affect the subsequent treatment adversely.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open trial, in which PPI pre-treated adults (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) were treated with a PI, predominantly with low dose knight avir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred three- and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average variable from baseline value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-submission threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unblocked aspiration is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years of age, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, asgenera solution was used to intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with asgenera.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbundled" "" "asgeneris should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the average duration (t100) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for CMAx reduced by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration at the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affected the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir that represents the active portion is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total drug concentration at the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit or inhibit CYP3A4 or a medium of CYP3A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with aspiration (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of asgenera capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, results in a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bio-bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerel's solution and aspiration capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of kidney dysfunctions should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma gauges similar to those that are achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir two times a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas appeared in dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence suggesting a clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic in a standard battery of In-vivo and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microcore test on rats and chromosomal aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of asgenera nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to humans, were observed in a number of minor changes including thymus-ongation and minor skeletal changes that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If asgenera capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of rite avir (booster), higher doses of asgenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for amonase capsules amounts to 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the active ingredient concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Aging should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases, for CMAx reduced by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg konavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of konavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended for a close-meshed monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If this medicine is used together, caution must be taken; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Riphautin together with asgenera, at least half of the recommended dose is recommended for a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, fluorescasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous offering of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with asgenera, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg Norethindron) led to a reduction in AUC and Cmin of amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2081">A reproduction study on vile rats administered by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period of amprenavir showed a diminished increase in body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of asgenera was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdosing, the patient is aware of signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both on acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbundled" asgeneris should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total drug concentration at the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit or inhibit CYP3A4 or a medium of CYP3A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with aspiration (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible; therefore, the effect of kidney dysfunctions should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas ocepatocellular adenomas complied with the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of the exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod cream in a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial were shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common one, probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream in relation to the side effect, were in these studies a response to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials involving Imiquimod cream patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials involving three-week treatment with Imiquimod cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excloriation / unrest (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often lead to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe grading and scarring (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotony which normalized following oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetical study, systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete recovery of the hands in an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients treated 119 with Imiquimod, the patients healed completely; this was the case at 20% of the patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved in 23% of 157 treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 treated male patients (95% CI).</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod with five-time use per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumours were histologically confirmed single primary superficially basal cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod for three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic active lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 area of treatment on the uncomfortable scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external susceptices, actinic keratosis and superfical basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drug in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rat doses ranging from 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg to significantly lowered body weight and increased spleen weight; a study conducted for the dermal application for four months revealed no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumors at the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod only has a minor systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk to humans due to systemic exposure is considered very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements complicate, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need medication before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years old, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed for more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known, and if necessary update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme in response to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to the Genzyme Europe B.V. company to transfer Aldurazyme to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect related to the infusion or the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where revitalization devices for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients with IgG antibodies against Laronidase are likely to form within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, it must be cautious due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pre-treatment 60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyreka) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquine or procain because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular inclusion of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, which include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is available to newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions including bronchospasm, breath stills and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe follow-up and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a serum conversion was performed within 3 months after the onset of the treatment, with a more severe follow-up form within a month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to an early withdrawal from the study), no investigable antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with whom there was never seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, while in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic larvae activity in vitro, which did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells in the lysosomes, most likely via mango-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy was the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute housing test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and hearing, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased in proportion to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) had a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel was found in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease-manifestation between the patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expectant percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk test, movement range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted to examine the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe traversal form and 4 with mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg due to increased levels of Gag- Mirrors in Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were noted after the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe follow-up form only limited or no advances in the cognitive development were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG-mirrors in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetrexed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin experienced an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the single dose of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies patients, in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, showed longer survival times in the administration of Alimta than with the comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the placing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved by 4.2ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with Cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Cal advanced or metastatic non-single-cell lung cancer, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period and for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetry, a complete blood picture should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose check must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle, taking account of the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be terminated if in patients with 2 dose reductiositives, an haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- continues at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased risk of side effects in patients aged 65 years or older than 65 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min there was no need for dose adaptations that go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Biliruby limit and / or transmine values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (for the occurrence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients have to be monitored with regard to bone marrow immunosuppression and Pemetremixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neutrochangels again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrality, thrombocyte count and maximal non-haematological toxicity, as observed in the preceding cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-chromatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients with Pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophy- lactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for which a Pemetremixed therapy is prescribed, should avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the transcellular space a drainage of the effluent before Pemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving pemetremixed when this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment should be advised to seek advice regarding the sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">High doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced pemetremixed elimination with the result of increased reoccurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution must be taken if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The major intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulae.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit to the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive ability is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised to seek advice regarding the sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetremixed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Side effects Frequency data: very common (≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000) and not known (based on the available data of spontaneity).</seg>

<seg id="2426">Serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular insulin and transitory ischemic attacks were reported in hospital studies with pemetremixed, which is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In clinical studies patients with Pemetremixed treatment were occasionally reported cases of coli- tis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis, and typhlitis).</seg>
<seg id="2428">In patients with Pemetremixed treatment, in cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory insufficiency, patients were reported from clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It was reported on cases of acute renal failure in Pemetrexed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were treated before, during or after their Pemetremixed therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antiseptic that breaks its effect by interrupting important foldable metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifolat with several attack points by blocking the thyme dylatsythase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotide myltransferase (GARFT), which are key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, simple-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had clinically meaningful survival compared to those patients who were treated only with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the patient arm (randomized and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in relation to the single Cisplintin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomised, open Phase III study with ALIMTA for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with prior chemotherapy showed median survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on overall survival was in favour of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-medial histological type (n = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0.047), adapted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a separate randomised, controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for pemetremixed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pre-treatment are similar to docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The efficacy analyses of the PQ population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non-inferiority of the ALIMTA Cisplatin combination compared to gemcitabine Cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2501">Dissolve the content of the 500 mg flow bottles with 20 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) without preservatives, resulting in a solution with concentric concentration of about 25 mg / ml pemetremixed.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colourless to yellow or greenish-yellow, without compromising the quality of the pro- ductive quality.</seg>
<seg id="2503">It is used in overweight adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low-calorie, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who are taking all i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the diet, thereby making about a quarter of the fats that are fed with food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received 460 mg after one year reported an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of all i (observed for more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches on the anus, flatus (winds) with stucco, stool, oily / oily chair, finish of oily secretions (fences), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It must not be applied to patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant women or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a licence for the placing of Orlistat GSK throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocritical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally absorbed, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Premature (see Section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Section4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single-meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes is accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli, because the dosage of antidiabetic medicine may need to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional precautionary measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction in Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (internationally normal ised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After a one-time dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are linked to the pharmacological action of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to compromises with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In most cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosage, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, it is possible to proceed from a rapid regression of possible systemic effects caused by the lipastic properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect prevails in the lumens of the stomach and the upper bowel by covalent bonding to the active Serin-rest of the gastric and pankretic lips.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of orlistat is taken three times a day, which blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 substantiate the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocritical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in study which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value of 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable for 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) without signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Laconiring) and M3 (M1, after splitting the N-Formyl-Leucine group), were identified in a study with adipous patients, which represented approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenem potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Pharmackovigilance system The holder of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmacovigilance system, as described in the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.8.1. of the authorisation application, will be applied and works before and while the product is available on the market.</seg>

<seg id="2570">For more helpful information on the blue pages in Section 6, see how you can define your calorie and fat outer borders.</seg>
<seg id="2571">If you leave a meal or eat a meal no fat, take no capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat, you risk food-related side effects (see section 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to your new eating habits, start your first capsule intake with a calorie and fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Nutritional tissues are effective as you can understand what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To achieve your target weight safely, you should specify two daily targets in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Nutrition to help reduce dietary factors (see Section 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity. • Stay physically active during the intake and after the seizure of alli.</seg>
<seg id="2578">• If you cannot find any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of use of alli, please ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2579">You may need to stop taking alli. • If weight loss is successful, it is not about switching off your diet and returning to the old habits.</seg>
<seg id="2580">• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal, pick up the capsule. • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal, take no capsule.</seg>

<seg id="2585">It is not known how often these effects occur. • Increasing of certain liver enzyme levels • Effect on blood clotting in patients who use warfarin or other blood-thinners (anticoagulating) drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment, as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet-related side effects: • Begin a few days, or better a week before the first intake of the capsules with a fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main court or a substantial dessert, as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Store drug for children inaccessible. • Do not use alli after the expiration date stated on the box • Do not store over 25 ° C. • Keep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers containing silicon, which serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2596">A lasting weight loss, for instance by improving nutrition and more exercise, can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients, and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of foods. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Note the tables below in this section. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">The amount of calories you are suitable for can be found in the information below that indicates the number of calories you are suitable for.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By adhering to recommended fat intake, you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likelihood of diet-related side effects. • You should try to decrease progressively and continuously.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Less physical activity" means that you daily burn only little or even not, stairs, work in the garden or other physical activities. • "Medium physical activity" means that you burn 150 kcal per day, e.g. through 3 km walk, 30- to 45-minute gardening work or 2 km of running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For permanent weight loss, it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them. • Sense is a nutritional journal with information about calorie and fat content of your meals.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calorie and fat-duets and give guidelines to become more physically active.</seg>
<seg id="2607">In combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss, this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight.</seg>
<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies that are moderate dissolvers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding an additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine which can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong and moderate causes of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapy, the moderate dissolation for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison to Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon assay, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised with simultaneous offering of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi will not be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not block the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycleabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (amethasone and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, chionavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events (a total of 633 patients) were reported (a total of 633 patients), which could at least be associated with Aloxi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of delivery (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy in an alopic overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg. Dolasetron (half-time period of 4 hours) or 100 mg dolasetron received intravenous day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 microgram Palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of intravenous Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption After intravenous administration followed an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminally half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are proportionally proportional to the whole dose range of 0.390 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following an intravenous dose of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average plasma concentration of 11 testicular cancer patients was measured between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) in the palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once a daily intravenous dose of 0,25 mg palonosetron was compared to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) measured after one-time intravenous dose of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time release of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies of metabolization have shown that CYP2D6 and, to lesser extent, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found in urine, Palonosetron as unaltered ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection in healthy patients the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver disorders have severe liver dysfunction and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron is increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies there was evidence that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses palonosetron (each dose was equivalent to the 30x of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined in humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the approval of the authorisation for the placing of the medicinal products intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue is damaged, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are abnormal in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon has presented data that demonstrate the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference point of reference to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were voiced to ensure that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease again flared with more patients than with the reference doctor; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crustenosis) and small infected infirmary, abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been provable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarmania may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients aged 9 months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together on skin wounds, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (eitergefilled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been provably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an irritation at the surfacing point.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The CHMP committee concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small firs, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. an authorisation for the placing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and considered an alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation due to the use of retapamulin ointment, the treatment is aborted, the ointment carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection can be begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinol should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retinosulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on poor skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on skinned skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adaptations are not considered necessary when topical Retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity according to oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the effects of birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the breastfeeding continues / terminates or the therapy with altargo should be continued / terminated, the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman should be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the date of delivery, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s ablation of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggests that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and preventing normal formation of active 50s-ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retinol should appear questionable at least some forms of infection, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinosulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% retinosulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and scented skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of traumatic traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 with the adult patients prior to medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of skimmed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive functioning of the liver and thyroid.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro testing on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rat micro-core test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats evidence of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skeg skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-times the estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application, is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the marketing authorisation holder agrees to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmackovigilance plan, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Humanuse," the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot show you should quit the use of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, mouth or lips, nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, with a protection against hepatitis B possibly only after the second dose is reached.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunisation, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan that is made out of two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix may be given or another hepatitis A or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by helping the immune system (the body's natural defense), as it can fight against disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix has the same components as the Vaccine Twinrix Adult approved since 1996 and the vaccines registered since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinhead adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations to hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in six months and a 12 month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccines) are headache, loss of appetite, pain in the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals approval to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the primordial portfolio with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-HBsAg) antibodies are in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured, if immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination need a refresher as protection, as they may also be protected by the immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, adequate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of formalin-activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels after the primary dimpression, so that in these cases the gift of additional doses can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously in thrombocytopenia or blood clotting problems, since in these cases it can lead to bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection using a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there is possibly no sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier thiomersal- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination factor.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturities on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of subjects who had administered Ambirix were suffering from pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matrix was comparable to each proband (i.e. about the overall vaccination cycle in 39.6% of subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to those observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose inoculation scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that which was observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the age of 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccine that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccination scheme with the combination of 360 ELISA- units of formalinininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in infants aged 1 to 15 years, the dose rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose administered for the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6, after the 3-dose dye was administered with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccine received either a 2-dose inoculation scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose inoculation scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to those that were detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable to the 0-6- month vaccination scheme in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time with the refresher of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellulum pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resorting to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / your child will take additional medicines (including those you could get without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently / has been given or has been given or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgently needed that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since the issuance of the initial approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only launched in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In patients aged over a month, ammonia can be used in pre-history with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - distributed on several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a stoma stomy (through the abdominal wall in the stomach of the leading hose) or a nose probe (through the nose into the stomach of the leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as Ammonola could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo agent, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">In addition, ammonia can lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders or taste sadition, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, too high ammonia levels were effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "ammonia was approved, because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information was given to this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), an indication exists for the use when a hyperammonic encephalopathy occurs in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granulate form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early-manifest lack of cargosyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsythetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with hiccups, as there is a risk for the origination of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the case of subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowing of the neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted into the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events had assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate acidosis, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity during intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that conjugated through acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylmonosodium, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Morphometrically, phenylacetylmonosodium is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylmonglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram-biased sodium phenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylmonosoagglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease led to death itself in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analoga during the first year of its life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn babies at postpartal (but within the first months of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of a hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithine transcarbamylase defect), which were recovered from a hyperammonic encephalopathy and treated thereafter permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, with phenylacetylmonosoglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in healthy adults and patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also investigated in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected in 15 minutes after the intake of measurable plasma concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In most cases, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) showed no phenylacetate in the plasma after different doses (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma gas were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylmonglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no negative effects in toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Garnet is either taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with hiccups) or via a stoma stoma or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early-manifest lack of cargosyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat aid was exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) before birth, lesions were found in the pyramids of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate acidosis, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Morphometrically seen is phenylacetylmonglutamine with urea similar (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylmonglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excreting excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylmonosodium glutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle it can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyrate, taken for each gram, is produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylmonosodium glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granule form, plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were found 15 minutes after the intake of measurable plasma concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can retain the finished product only once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring scoop contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring scoop of 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the drug over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the lactation period, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may pass into mother's milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, obstruction of hearing, disorientation, memory disturbance and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for instance for unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stem uplift."</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in connection with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) and compared to conventional combined treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was frequently used as a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure), and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days and one year as much as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients with a PCI, angiox was as effective as heparin with regard to all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalira, other Hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The CHMP committee concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve angiox marketing throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a further consequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After clinical need, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An intake of 0.5 mg / kg is required immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous inducing of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intravenous infusion at a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single capus-administration of angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the studs have to be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is given properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, it is possible to administer a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg / kg and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second one.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI-study (REPLACE-2), which led to the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 Patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis are contraindicated by angiox (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against miludine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of haemostasis system and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when they are administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemiial occlusions occur in PCI patients, most haemorrhages in arterial occlusion may occur in patients undergoing acute coronary arthrombosis (PCI) during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">For patients receiving Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudin is again achieved prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the anticoagulant mechanism (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregators) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalry with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters must be checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental studies are inadequate with regard to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, unbinding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalira alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalira group and the comparison groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe hemorrhages were significantly less frequent than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage, hemoglobin level ≥ 4 g / dl without apparent bleeding, reduction of haemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known hemoglobin mirror, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhages that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasional) were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose, or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bivaloriudin at 6000 patients who have undergone a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalira group and the comparison groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above were reported in practice according to a comprehensive application and are grouped by system organists in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalira is immediately broken down and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalira, a direct and specific thrombin inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic centre and the anion-barking region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin turn on its part slowly cleaves the attachment of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, by using serum-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS), no thrombocyte aggregation reaction was induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalira demonstrates a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was subsequently performed in the patient, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalira was given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery was increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the beginning of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or at the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were evenly distributed across the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography in 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra becomes subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin luliosis is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin levels was observed after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin luliosis or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or deltoid muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose generation capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the active strength, the brand (manufacturer), the type of insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can lead to a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dose or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, Salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the effects of sympathetic agents such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reservoir can be weakened or absent from the symptoms of the adrenergic antigen regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- lingluliosis and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed to oral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed in the following are the undesirable medications known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organists and ordered according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive huntigers, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to continuously switch the injection site within the injection area, can occur in the following a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluctival injections, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulitin the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than in the case of hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes melliontus, insulin luliosis in the therapeutically relevant metering range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucosity, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosesenkescent effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulitin has twice as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosesenkescent effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postpranic glycaemic control is reached like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When insulin lulitin was served two minutes before the meal, a better postpranic control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given two minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulitin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mixes before the meal (see Figure 1), is reached.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulitin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulitin in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to humane normal mallow, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
