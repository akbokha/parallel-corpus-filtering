package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
for more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions , see &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Add extensions ... Open the flash@@ card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available .
the module An@@ gle filter ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ item , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for different symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportion@@ ate to its size .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected even when they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have useful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . it will be drawn frame to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and those boxes need space , which is then lost to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic .
how split@@ ting the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . hereby , it is always advantageous for labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames so that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minim@@ ally represented area for an entry above the menu item view An@@ taining to area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the image gallery can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the gallery image gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a rot@@ ational field to adjust the number of mini pictures of each line in the gallery .
the file name of the image shows whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
show the file size check box to see if the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
display the image size check box to determine if the size of the images is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save in HTML file , specify where to store the HTML page .
by accessing sub @-@ folders with the check box , you can set a slider to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied into the gallery .
if you want to use the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings offers easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Tools HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the Media Play@@ back for the navigation area can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu under window navigation pane , or with the key short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only to certain browsers .
the default browsing id of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that does not deny access to this browser , change browser recognition to one of the following options .
change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browsing detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes , are correctly represented with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the In@@ sert menu item ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ module check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , dozens of professional skills are available . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ cam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report .... This opens a dialog with a sub@@ merged connection . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error report system . all required information is already registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful of this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get started &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . guide to report in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply insert path names or click on the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ ously set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top@@ most folder , which contains images , as base folder . &amp; edited ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ring recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can not exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this can be done by adding a point in front of the folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ pop do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and disc@@ arding it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can go to &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ cam ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported video cameras in the Help Menu Help .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports also Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and comm@@ its over the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read thumb@@ nails . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ cam ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ cam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F in full @-@ screen mode .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if it is displayed in symbol view . which fields can be displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were recorded on the disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ characteristics or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have a scanner installed , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose album Import images scan to do so . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album .
to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album Colle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you collection is used to sort your photos , or sort albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Years : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the section of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ tin , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you then want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports key words for single photos in the area My key word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will display the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the pictures will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you must wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate thumb@@ nails .
information about each image will be displayed below the preview . what information these are can be edited via Settings . select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help buttons that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all it &apos;s happening at &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can reach all the features with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can reach all the features with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... select . in the edited editing pane , you will find a guide on how to edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; edited ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview button and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; edited , it is moved to the garbage b@@ ins of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My Date Light &amp; quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; quot ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture gallery . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the data view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key word button ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the image data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords will be re @-@ imported when the database is lost , as soon as the images are deleted .
you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My sampling &amp; quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use &amp; edit the functionality with keyword , you first have to put your photos with keyword . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can also click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keywords .
you can add a photo with any number of words . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keyword , this will be displayed in the main window while previ@@ ew@@ ing the image .
you can remove a keyword by right @-@ clicking on the context menu of the photo and selecting Rem@@ ove from the menu menu . the menu will show you only the keywords associated with the photo .
the time beam view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the box below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amps and in the future even more .
if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can search this search here as a live search , which always filter what you entered as a search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after search again , you just have to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select Add as Advanced Search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . here you find more rules for searching . for more information , see the Advanced search tool .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields from &amp; digi@@ .exe ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules will be added to this list with search group / search group . any option can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one . if you slide a picture from somewhere beyond the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right images . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it . move it while you pull the left mouse button . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened . if you are in &amp; digi@@ box again ; main windows are , you can quickly open the light table using L Extras .
from the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . if you select preview from the tool@@ bar and execute Zoo or cro@@ pping operations on one of the pictures , then they are also executed with the other image . so you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a series of pictures . if you navigate pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to compare it . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it on the left . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly out of the light table such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling feature that you can see on the crossed arrows . to change the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; press preview and then both images will display the same image area .
the zoom function works just like in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos picks up , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , find , protect , and re @-@ use your images . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers who have &amp; digi@@ aded ; use . we will focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; digital stock management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find a certain photo without stock management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files ensures very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files need to be organized somehow on your computer . you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly through your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the metadata settings page . this ensures EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam ; to give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos while working .
let us now deal with keywords , keywords , as well as other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it becomes &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you or simply insert the pictures in the right place . changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graph shows how different met@@ a @-@ data inter@@ s@@ ect . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data refer to properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream of associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help him understand the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label on its own .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even put it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will not tell you a second time for publishing .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train of the spatial presentation now moves with speed of light .
the possibilities offered by ge@@ olo@@ cation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will be even deep@@ ening in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographic indications . &amp; nbsp ; can also export k@@ ml files you can export with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
this field contains the name of the photographer . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failures , plate failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , dis@@ ast@@ er@@ Pre@@ vention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery agency , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously and you may not be trusted for more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are deals on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claims a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disk@@ ettes , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is , of course , also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . after that , read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then stored on a clean , dark dry and protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives for this subject :
electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason for S@@ MA@@ RT . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT @-@ defined errors indicate the imminent failure . this is in particular read errors and storage counters . the expected lifetime amounts between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without great problems .
while most electrical appliances do not make a lot of electrical sho@@ cks , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause serious damage . so on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause distorted key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember , however , not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed especially for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for traveling .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models even allow them to continue working until the current runs again . if you purchase a U@@ PS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of current disrup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage , which should be reviewed in reality .
from the point of view of data security , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed storage .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs keep at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they create inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
sun Micro@@ systems Z@@ FS seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ lower fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms used by the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % on the work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks are already 50 % of the share of theft .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . meaning that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no other responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so secure your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous , such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing disks .
suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash strikes you are lucky if the drive wasn &apos;t connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss in spite of f@@ use the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a sn@@ apshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete sn@@ apshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential locking .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync merely copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
back up important images directly after saving them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
this approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly sn@@ apshot for at least one month and a sn@@ apshot of each month .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC saved in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , original storing , storage , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the time in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variations you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have budget@@ ed the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t app@@ end it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in M@@ B@@ b ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # modi@@ fies the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard that should replace GI@@ F . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF is stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and oblig@@ ated to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provides D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &amp; quot ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; which stands for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP matches this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include working on an architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections , and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera screen , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ layer editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit , then you should add metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright using a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edit ; in the addition of a photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . for more description , see the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ menting indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not provide thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application of any file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the required selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected can be downloaded until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New can be downloaded . until now , these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ .@@ In this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
the list of existing albums is displayed in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is shown in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once , by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , then you must first select it and delete er@@ ased dele@@ tion .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully review if the photos were successfully added to a &amp; edited ; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this about the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use meaningful names as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos . the file names are normally re@@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names if you load photos of different recording files into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the commit opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data to the author in the Standard Auto Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different date format than the default format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix photo % y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . to do so , turn on the option Date &amp; Time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you are using the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , it can be downloaded ; use this to automatically load sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ folder . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually disabled , and in this case , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub@@ verb@@ s at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply want to document the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references . the question is actually more about how the data comes into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a follow @-@ up of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must store this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from pictures and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you so much control over his work flows as possible . to access these settings , you need to edit settings in the Settings menu ; select set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select Action can be displayed on a saved preview or start image processing . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s title : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of other &amp; quot ; Provi@@ den@@ quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image , and not only in the digi@@ code database ; and this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ cam ; imported without going lost .
save image descriptions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the in@@ scriptions embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests on a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the brightness of &amp; quot ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the light table these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast machines . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you are using image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light colour in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this mode of view can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are en@@ coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with P@@ NG Com@@ pression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , as P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF file compression option , you can switch the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss @-@ ease setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . at present , it is very fast becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image editing settings .
if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under exposed pictures you get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the spot@@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned , because of the inability of your camera to capture the spot@@ lights as a transparent white . use the setting to solve some unusual results as they show the spot@@ lights in various pink tones . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the re@@ constructions option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . to keep the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial @-@ raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provides you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like that . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color vari@@ ance of your lens , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction as it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the color information from one color space to translate to the other are thus the colors to be as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Sets here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles .
settings of ICC Pro@@ files You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures and does not manage the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color t@@ onal mapping or gam@@ ma@@ ke@@ per@@ ture . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the t@@ onal mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your picture would be restored by a device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors so you can adjust manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a set of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these will be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ .@@ These modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller adjust the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn on or off the metadata that appears at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the frame display mode .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / image , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the menu of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the garbage b@@ ins , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; edit ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the cli@@ pping of a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without re@@ viewing . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also read &amp; edit the display of the welcome screen . this speeds under certain circumstances , acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
the setting When you start looking for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , queries &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; dialog ; use to customize the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings in Settings design from the tool@@ bar . previ@@ ew@@ ing the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; find out more about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the entry Display / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your picture before you change it . you can do this with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the button The Rest@@ ore of image processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done on the photo since last saving .
almost every action of image processing can be und@@ one or recovered . the last action can be und@@ one by modi@@ fying or restoring working from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same Album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or icons in tool@@ bar or entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen display displays the photo in full screen mode . you will be displayed in the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can edit this in the Settings dialog . if you do not want to , you can view this in the Settings dialog . see the section for setting up image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image from the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases . you just have to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navig@@ ational arrows , also available in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
in the label view , you can enter or paste labels with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then stored .
besides the user button there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata adjustment that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field Ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword index shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key word tree , and a selection box with the keywords used in this &amp; edited .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is applied only to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a sample with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the page bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - date , keyword and search results is used . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays images on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off using Settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an advanced search on all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner are a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , colour management means making informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
your only other image output is by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why do you have to use another color space to think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB comparison in comparison with the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excell@@ ente page and then click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to install my monitor if I have decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cryst@@ alli@@ ze your monitor because s@@ RGB sounds that your ; on@@ itor works on s@@ RGB . if you are working as a s@@ RGB colour space , you must either cryst@@ alli@@ ze your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Con@@ duc@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection are trying to make the best out of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest dot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
counter@@ balance : this method mim@@ ics the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the compar@@ ision produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
ampli@@ fy contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a revision of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a little limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can be too far from the original image areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your chances of correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the image below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right , a hist@@ ogram is shown that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your results depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load keys do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set you can save to a text file and relo@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also create another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color t@@ onal mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter Color Administration .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to save them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool to gra@@ dation that you will find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ aded ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when exposed to a partially developed pressure of a short flash light . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to adjust the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too great satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog on this tool is very complicated , you only need the scope of the slider for the purpose described here . concrete the three slide below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected range . under the graph , three slide valves are cli@@ cked into the window and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can choose whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful .
three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle notes , often called gam@@ ma@@ ges .
the three color pin@@ points can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to modify the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create an extended image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and relo@@ aded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the entries of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a short section to the right , e.g. the light tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . turn on the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer der &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer in image processing .
select the color for the hist@@ ogram with the channel selection box : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider .
the image preview has a red marker . when you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to keep L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will also retain the overall brightness , as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . colored consists of small noise files that do not appear on the same spot in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save and load any mixer setup for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film reel profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scenes and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filtered .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yel@@ low@@ ish filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ pe . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on one image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ wn eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . round the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce finishes it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , de@@ can@@ ted it with a nice three dimensional frame .
width : the width of the frame is in percent . the range of value for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the pattern decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool template you can put a template on a picture .
the Image Sch@@ abl@@ one menu applies in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template , simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil file with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
once the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder will automatically update the template &apos;s preview pane .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to shr@@ unk the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produced especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it does not work a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digital@@ isation process colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little bl@@ urred . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera has often been used internal sharp@@ ness . however , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field of focus while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness index . you can call this with the menu item Cor@@ rigi@@ dly Field .
you should be careful with this , since the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can focus on more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to mark sof@@ ten@@ ers with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ y soft markers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are generated near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should sharp@@ est pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ urred image one of the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference @-@ amount . this can be used to define a minimum difference in order for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the notes are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example for the bl@@ ur@@ ry mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ ry mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted de@@ fl@@ ing filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique to sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus usually achieves better results than bl@@ ur@@ ry mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice , the circle @-@ shaped folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ els , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is Gau@@ ß . this is most often caused by a previously performed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should drop this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value of non@@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , please note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ieren produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by har@@ ming mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theoretically , un@@ sharp masks always have to create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Vienn@@ ese filter , it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the field correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ thing knob bl@@ ends the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour tin@@ ted colour allows an adapted colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to make the restoration easier . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is subsequently necessary . please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction depen@@ dency .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a movie basket or CCD rou@@ ches , a high value wave @-@ like pattern will generate . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ el@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . hence , set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the Save as and Load keys do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
correc@@ ting image defects is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and require a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button ab@@ ort .
below you can see how to remove image defects with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller mistakes are adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch to the front looking for lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or black@@ s@@ mi@@ er occurs again .
edges : controls the edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more obsc@@ ured , but also gre@@ ases the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the adjustment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter will appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction is applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to mark sof@@ ten@@ ers with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ y soft markers and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Load keys do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and require a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected unter ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the poor pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the button dark@@ en . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and relo@@ ad it automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ quad@@ r@@ atic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo formats , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 with aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since there would otherwise be bl@@ ur effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ Filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker &apos;s copyright .
with three controls you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting in an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu colour gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fla@@ ws on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually .
in general : this value controls the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value appears more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; Corner parameter has the revers@@ ed in@@ signia of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size , resulting in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image shr@@ inks .
ligh@@ tening : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion parameter . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ ne or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing from image processing or via the zoom knob of this dialog .
for most pictures the sound @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate inf@@ ra @-@ red tape of the G@@ implic@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters to set cinem@@ at@@ ography and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO knob changes the amount of film grain and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color information is missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ red filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO levels generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the makers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value , although higher values are required , can be set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ aded ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life @-@ life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide image is 1 and smoo@@ thes 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you chose to sketch yourself .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ stro@@ y landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button termin@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that radi@@ ate from one center point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image by rotating the pixels at a central point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a turning camera .
distance bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to appear in the background .
movement bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera .
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking : bl@@ urs the image due to random shift of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : find the color pool in the picture and bl@@ ur it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural your images a wet appearance . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen film . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ former Dre@@ aming / Trans@@ former Spi@@ der menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many imaging programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm image bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as text file and relo@@ aded later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by magni@@ fying a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a photo you simply have to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply clicking with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save file or save file in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview section you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait mode , the greater value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the composition help make it possible to blend aids in order to better compose your pictures . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to share a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides smoo@@ ther relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads to the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect of dynamic symmet@@ ry called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve differently .
the options Horiz@@ on@@ tal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the objects rotate around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the turn is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing from image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally cutting feature . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image after the turn . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . you will then automatically re@@ compu@@ te the preview . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly gre@@ ased . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing out of the image processing .
the locking tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal pattern , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers sciss@@ ors .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit bl@@ urred . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two insulation causes twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aling the image has un@@ si@@ ghtly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats to which knows . this is done by file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is displayed in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of shell images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ cam ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; edited ; however , is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; click ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program to play .

if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to do the photo editing are included in &amp; edited . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tening , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you will see &amp; quot ; texture users quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane , otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the picture from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it . move it while you pull the left mouse button . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ let files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and Hot Custom Color and Last used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue palette , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or browse the folder after files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing was selected .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ections can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then you will find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .
&amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; included are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ .@@ The &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; displays graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; posters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; posters ; re @-@ calculate the graph and represent it in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ graphs ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of Rec@@ ently opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog File .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph .
if the currently in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings k@@ graphic viewer ; use it , see also .
when you open a graph file outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; instance or want to present the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice dur@@ ably , but also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to divide the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .

the Renew@@ al Load site gives the possibility to specify the behavior if a file has been modified on the disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically relo@@ ad or ignore changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; inter@@ viewer ; to set a graph outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time it is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewers ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for every start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered diagrams . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ app@@ ings as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ lighted graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the jump spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to a statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for non @-@ lay@@ ered graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ h@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module displays images to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source like video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry pictures , a dialog appears , which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default duc@@ ts in order to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image using the button Scan . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual , you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings might not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the image file . please remember that type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore produces very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image by saving the image .
screen@@ shots can be created after you have selected in the Import folder &gt; Screen Picture ... menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to get the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
this module will archive your albums on CD / DVD Media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can easily select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . also , the Auto@@ Play option is available for the Windows platforms .
K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and other capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , put the photos of your camera online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication , so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful login the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will see the dialog for upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ its to Fli@@ ck@@ r to Fli@@ ck@@ r two times , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , you need write permission . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button pictures should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as key words during the upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the option to change the size of the photos before upload , the photos will be changed before upload in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed to keep the aspect ratio unchanged .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no track data from one location for pictures , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location lies in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these boundaries here and then press the knob to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog moves the coordinates from one call to the next , you only have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . choose the region in question and enlarge it . always select this again until you reach a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a HTML page image gallery to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 in order to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the preview preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be created in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ,
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth . this naturally affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider &apos;s thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for the preview pictures , these are small pictures that will be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . he was developed for fast image display and quick access to his functions .
after the start , a picture is shown as default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change pictures without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Client module is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list of k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the picture you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please take a look at ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a base image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD formats for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Extras m@@ peg slide show .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . if you plan to reproduce the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that displays a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg file . if possible , keep mp@@ g as soon as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then this will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start the creation of the movie with the button code . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a coffee quickly or in all peace and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if a note appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages above the button settings right down .
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera maker . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information from your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , for example by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to convert all images into one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images in an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can scale or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : no proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo papers . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the pictures you previously selected . add more pictures using the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right side .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button pictures remove the selected pictures from the list of images to be sent away .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you have selected are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t forget to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the pictures in a text file and the mail is added .
the P@@ NG format under the picture file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and the original files in JPEG format , then original @-@ export data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL Transi@@ tions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Show File names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it using Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option to random@@ ly select images ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it does not use the order of the images in the album .
between the images the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance , however , depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects that you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on you .
with this tool@@ bar you can pause the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date now has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your images and videos with comments , you can browse &amp; photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , view the current preview images .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons are to be seen . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can mit &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture above .
to view images next to the names , select the button on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can choose which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage of allowing you to view the view for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable image for your keywords ) .
however , you must define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you need to open the image @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the entry categories editor in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you access the search window in the main window , a dialog is displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you would like , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be a part of the total date , i.e. , 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here you will see pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals but want to try out some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry K@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try it out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time line . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this guide shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show this date in the preview list ) and also the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create through the File HTML menu ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the flash and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file to be created on the overview page . you will find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer on your site can change the resolution at any time you have set . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
please select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can verify that they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you have to copy them manually . so the import function , see , properly works you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings above have all three related to base folders and URLs . in these settings , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time on the pictures , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . then you do not have to do this work again .
with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file . the advantage of saving all the images into the file is that you can have all the pictures together and pass this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images twice . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the appropriate images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following is the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
to copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; copy files to the .@@ k@@ im file with the Automati@@ cally option ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the option Export file .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying , for example , that each image should be at the most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File import ... select , will import &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , after that , in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file to the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you see pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass the different steps of ( 1 ) setting up the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual we talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . this is a simple XML file , which you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ stores the folder in which your images are stored and used them automatically at future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; i.e. another folder tree with images , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry Settings C@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings options are explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available that can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select an inscription and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up entire groups of members , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all group members as explained in a group .
in the selection list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ cam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little ones have been tested . therefore , you should always try new modules first with the demo database before you access them on your own pictures . demo database you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; K@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : an album is just a folder . even though &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for some modules to make use of the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
simul@@ ating &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the pictures that show you the preview currently .
in addition to the current album , I have to pass a list of albums to the modules . here we go &amp; photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you , for example , use the category people , &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you &apos;d selected persons to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture , you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain a lot of information as you do not yet have information about your pictures . in the section we will return to this window , now click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image is taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box , where you can specify people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on shifting the images inside the list . for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , by doing so that the names used are moved up , the persons can find and assign them faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sort by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the United States as a control group . to show you that it is an over @-@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an item to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top of the frame . you can also make a separate window by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... button , which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and then hide / hide the window . see this procedure in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Rem@@ ove button , or select Edit menu in the Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can also use the images anywhere , so &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the pictures somewhere , so &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; you can &apos;t view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them again . so , if you want to avoid trouble , such as the mess of your images , please buy a bigger hard disk to store all the pictures .
in the images menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those you want to make accessible to others and click on the current view lock in the File menu . alternatively , you can also control all the images your little sister may see , and lock the menu item Any@@ thing except current view .
with this you have set which pictures to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop now to your little sister , simply lock the menu entry pictures , so that all the images you have locked can be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , everyone can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , read out or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private pictures .
the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime . for this reason , &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional information you have entered through the image , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , appropriate entries to this display . so if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus keys . started and stopped the slide show by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer you can simply drag a rect@@ angle into the image . with the Min@@ us button , you can pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . the Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . using the same key sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus keys .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
when you view images it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view the image ab@@ ort and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to tag images with characters while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letters . in this picture you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have set the features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so if you see all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply tag them all at once . this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do straight away .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to view categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the picture was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will allow you &amp; photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your mean later .
to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select View on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not completely control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mode views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be shown with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . if you want to render a part of the texture , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse over the entire window .
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the super@@ ordin@@ ate object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the p@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ cards in the top of the views .
the last possible window order is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to lo@@ osen a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the p@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
you can save the current window view with view window order ... save . it displays a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon . Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the View scene menu item .
a render mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like , from a quick preview to full @-@ screen images .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the font file size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image cli@@ pping into the input fields .
in combination mode quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . the default is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continuously divided up and adap@@ table because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tra@@ verses a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 x 5 ( 25 ) will calculate additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays of each pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this tab , you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not met any object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console issue . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly ends , you can find the reason for this here .
to import one &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry File Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . here the path to your document and version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. elevation field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object @-@ catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions separately .
when you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections but requires more time to render .
if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is row@@ ed . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
when you cross the ground , a floor below the objects is row@@ ed . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and swelling value . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . the window instructions section explains how to create and save window orders .
the combination box standard window order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement using the Add button and delete a select arrangement using the button Rem@@ ove .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window order . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . with New Col@@ umn , you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with Kar@@ tei@@ map you get a flash@@ card view in common with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without a closer knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you &apos;ll get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ lessly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the knob or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ liche bodies Qu@@ ader ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an aw@@ k@@ ward method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then apply the Apply button or the En@@ try button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a limited infinite plane . when you render the scene , the level stretches up to the horizon .
when you view the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizon line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property tree ( name = ground @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigment shows only a matt black material , because you still need to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to carry out this step , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the floor by one unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , place a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select the first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or hit the input button .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection adjustments are already partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities for you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer will shoot hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been disc@@ arded since the last storage .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; repeat the last &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rever@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command . you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit Un@@ common . &quot; &quot; &quot;
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut keys and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction individually on the surface without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can show by clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return button .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images always want to use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , relo@@ ads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the key short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays great icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its share to report at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you problems or requests . this displays a dialog with a link . all required information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we would like to encourage you to ask other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; you can answer here questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful of this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to join is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; tries to give you so much control over its work flows as possible . to access these settings , you need to select in the Settings menu item ; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
in the range of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . in addition , the colors with what you are supposed to display should be in contrast . exposure should indicate a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; Channel ; is an application to scan images that do no longer scan and save images .
&amp; cann@@ lite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do no longer scan and save images . &amp; cann@@ lite ; can open a dialog for each image to save or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by typing the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; cann@@ lite ; with the command cann@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be placed in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; cann@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ans ) does not treat these options especially .
to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to an abor@@ tion and you will return to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button will open the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this option allows them to select the way &amp; channels ; select images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; cann@@ lite ; it will automatically be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is automatically counted every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button will start K@@ DE Help with the &amp; cann@@ lite ; manual . the Button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; channels ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; cann@@ lite ;
&amp; cann@@ lite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ans library used by &amp; cann@@ lite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; use like any other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can set you up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the global keyboard short@@ cut .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all needed modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates file , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands . in most cases , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it .
configure Speci@@ fies the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is picked up . the script could now query with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information about the new piece ( for example , metadata or unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry was cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can hang it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to browse through endless menus . maybe you just search for a certain title from thousands in your collection . mit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to listen to ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the choice is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to experience your music anew !
typically , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok source , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
when the option is off , only the Play@@ list window is displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for the mood bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for the mood bar . this changes the used colour scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
mood files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder &apos;s settings folder ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when moving , stores the current playlist automatically to the end of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; select this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible when the piece is changed , that the playlist window is sc@@ rolled / un@@ rolled to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
when you change a piece to the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can choose a font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector displayed below for foreground and background color .
playback at the start will cause &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color faces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if your own colors do not use , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the Display @-@ Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ card holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers also enable further adjustments to this tab .
the collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . it includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that is to search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up as with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : enable &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
im@@ porting play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination box Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setting is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup will be used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . on calcul@@ ator : if the machine is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that it is entered under port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for the connection to the database .
the capacity card last@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
interpre@@ ting similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a list of similar performers will retrieve the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD assume that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ teles@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to Tag@@ li@@ b / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
most of the time , this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will crash when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re @-@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . note that in some cases , up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this option shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ yl@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ yl@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok first finds the correct version .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily resolved by an expert using your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , only a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Tools Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the user &apos;s rating while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column display review . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose From playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there just as you would do with other files . so easy is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the button playlist . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ cur@@ sor , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be : which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer may even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default do not include MP3 de@@ co@@ ders ( for pat@@ ent@@ wise reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. , os@@ se@@ sink ) .
it does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less supports the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and crashes . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg file , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run @-@ register again . start now &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
please report to us at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find out the currently in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running titles when one is on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; window . to do so , press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changing window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right click the queue in the queue . by pressing the En@@ ter button after searching in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and playlist have tricky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous evaluation with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall score .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and clicking on the Edit : rating or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog &apos;s metadata .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means K@@ DE packages have a defined release plan that is not to be brought together with the short term set of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can easily find annoying . disable the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bars to set up ... and take the desired changes there .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also caused a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output will give you the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
the value of a plug @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter in the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio edition with Arts will not be taken care of . of course you are welcome to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much @-@ needed car@@ egi@@ ver for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes you will have set up .
the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for specific pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it instantly with the help of the playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you get different ways to load the playlist .
in order to play an audio CD , please select an audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play button .

&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a multi @-@ page multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers that allow you to capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display indicating the currently running piece or current stream . just below is the area , the play time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red play time to the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the run@@ time display . you can change through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also activated . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the play buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slide controls to set the play position or adjust the volume . with the play buttons you can start / stop the play and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the check box equ@@ ali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ lists by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that it does not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions sc@@ are them , they are all easy to use .
in the navigation area , you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , you find the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ window starts off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Tools statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to copy the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current play . see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover pictures in the context browser , the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously .
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favour@@ ites of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums by the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will pop up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , you will try to download the text for the piece from the internet . if no text script is still running , you can choose which is to be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing performer - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First of all , the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and there will be another split according to the album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack @-@ albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing performer / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are first displayed by genre , including by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - this attitude works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you have different time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . besides , you can also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically disabled .
right @-@ click on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This will empty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach the playlist to the playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transferring to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn on CD - thus the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the garbage b@@ ins ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selection - mark the selected album as compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in various performers .
up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment Mark@@ up - Change a compilation @-@ marked album back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under different performers but again under the corresponding artist .
the play@@ lists browser makes handling many play@@ lists easy . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Intelli@@ gent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , it must be included before the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; starts , you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer sort in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the commit is complete , quit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search field with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter separated search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries that either contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you would like to search for entries that contain spaces , then include the keyword with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field does , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example , review : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ a little search for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not have the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and then clicking on the entries with the right mouse button . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left @-@ hand side you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow reverse and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as what you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many other buttons available for tool@@ bars , such as playback controls and volume controls . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars ... select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking with the mouse double in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu .
one click on this entry opens the visu@@ alisation plugin window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; select .
this entry provides a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to appear in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this function you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the items in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that you already have some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist .
double @-@ click on the playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click on them with the right mouse button and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can start the play directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece by yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the latest playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled .
the New button re@@ stores the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . after that , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
specify a name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece of dup@@ licate in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed , taking into account the settings played .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand side settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you can add random pieces from each of the recorded play@@ lists .
some scripts allow you to set up your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package will be installed to install . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ting section .

this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats then remember that you will receive a worse quality when coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . now you see a dialogue that looks like this or something like that :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original image is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet , such programs are generally called Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ 1 decoder . currently it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Dec@@ oder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible , for example , to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . it can be useful , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog store below is shown with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between saving and making changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project to happen , just as if you have called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what will happen , as if you had called a file .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as when you directly view the files from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; open the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog for the current project . the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; causes burning of the medium . burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the property dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used .
this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
open the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you will then be able to burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD Cop@@ y dialog . this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . therefore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even possibilities to change size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar at the bottom of the window will be displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view has an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view is also the interface to read and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ strip is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ strip does not have any real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work straight away . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with an &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and style of your task is crucial to which of the accompanying programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
the D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ .d@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project through the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is an audio CD ; it is easy to read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard drive ) and supported by many en@@ co@@ ders who en@@ code these WAV files ( these Ko@@ di@@ erer packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional en@@ co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they are installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually a per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other code@@ cs must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ erer packages must be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
what encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass a protected audio CD ; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection .
while the setup has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily usage of the user interface is explained afterwards . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble over at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which code@@ c programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , for example , there is more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
if the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD data starts according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if an en@@ coder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the set @-@ up catalogue - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . it must be noted that before the en@@ coder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog for the type of notification ( such as logs , picks ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; termin@@ ating ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , compression ratios and compression ratios and helps you choose the right en@@ coder .
if no audio information is lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both en@@ coder produces very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ o@@ be for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding systems explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the machine . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I &apos;m not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; however , no one can prevent you from being har@@ med by the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway by a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active a check box to select ( send an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this kind of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if you are using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; those who want to know more about it , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
for saving the read WAV files , the en@@ coder and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab to set up the code . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer @-@ package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code , you can get more information about its switches by entering commands like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio code@@ cs of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found using a search engine , as it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have scre@@ ams on it ( eg by trying to copy something in with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; audio creator ; something that is supposed to be done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each output &amp; CD .
here we determine the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the selection range so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if you can access the drive with other programs , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the Kar@@ tei@@ Map General Settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information please select , so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords is missing .
the flash@@ card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the machine must be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is about 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load between the hosts is distributed . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but as many fire@@ walls do the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous plays : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , so simply try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything in such a way as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a little long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of wa@@ v files at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; c@@ video@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , is described and set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each output &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected for one &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; input data manually instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; find this example . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , now the &amp; CD ; in the drive that has been defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , look in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers to the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the tracks of the pieces are completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic search of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; field , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the comment field can be used for individual comments , the commentary box of the album will be used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary volume . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the encoding settings tab ; take a look at the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see Help for the code to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the end @-@ to @-@ end CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the information anyway . for more information go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock .
after choosing OK , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play . simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the tracks that are selected will be read out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; clicking on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button has started reading the selection process , so this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
click on the tab order to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format . thus , read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of though two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ fier of your choice .
&amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at people who comp@@ iling from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to suit your needs once it is running , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different font cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any c@@ lue as it will continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
what is this about ? who reads this , probably started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; c@@ audio@@ creator . if you want to add or change something useful , let it do . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to fetch the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke game player by &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke play of real @-@ time lyrics also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop to drag &amp; drop any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; ending while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can choose to open ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; Windows drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you draw it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the speed display to change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts the play . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
song lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again others . some pieces don &apos;t have a text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . so if you select the Automati@@ cal text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text is automatically selected . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries Tex@@ ter@@ ei@@ vers or L@@ ieder@@ text from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played after the series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find them in the Collection item under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . in the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the each one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . consider this if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu of the sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs , or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next Song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Previous item , the entry Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as E @-@ Mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section , you will see how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and don &apos;t leave any line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun shooting ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term &quot; drum patch &quot; the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is its presence . so , you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ word@@ lists are mostly used to make sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look at the provided Key@@ boards as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map with the name name is needed for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed only . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that will play a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave up . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of pi@@ v@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos , you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played notes . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the Channel view point : settings
tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
dis@@ agree , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have an &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I play a kar@@ aoke file ) , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ In . first you only want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ In . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.com Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and proving phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great joy if you send me a postcard from your home town or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact you ( if you want to ) . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written completely in my spare time and by no one cri@@ tiques money for it . I want to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .

and of course my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will find there also links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to comp@@ iling with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound@@ card , except that you can of course hear no music .
if problems occur , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level . when you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ sets will be copied to the current category and the play starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , selecting play@@ lists must be selected from the menu , either selecting the Edit Mode , or selecting another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the author &apos;s convenience , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / Pain@@ t ; &amp; lt ; / Pain@@ t ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; everything must be configured by typing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; you can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .

the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . the started process is called kn@@ pp@@ layer . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to always use a given back@@ end for a particular Mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog can be found in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b inside .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be working for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ sp@@ ection , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ r@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there hints on how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as root after the device is inserted . it is important to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; manage .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . among Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be applied to the package &amp; tex@@ as ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compilation and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact about the box should be made .
if questions arise or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; desktop . &amp; box ; provides the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management need to be called .
to find out more about &amp; posters ; and to learn its possibilities the manual for Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pron@@ unci@@ ation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also a La@@ y ( over@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while only a good review to &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to master &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books , eg . H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
as well as other sig@@ nage languages &amp; lat@@ ex , an introduction that defines the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry wizard from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers a number of possibilities for creating the document . some settings can also be made to the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , author &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for proper processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Buch ( DIN ) , Paper ( DIN ) , L@@ etter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information for this is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you want to see greater areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you notice it by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless .
with the automatic completion of environments , entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; box ; automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu Settings box ; Set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ section the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a click of a mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files , recovery search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI @-@ file was created &#91; i.e. , e V ice I n@@ dependence file &#93; &#93; , &amp; box ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the actual output art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file were kno@@ cked with the editor and as soon as an element was cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex . the pre @-@ search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex , source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is jumped .
master document : this function is used for work with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick release : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is located at any time , and there is no call from &amp; oc@@ cul@@ ation ; after quick construction .
the selection boxes have been developed for quick integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex . commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field Other is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , an image or a different element .
&quot; &quot; &quot; reference : is used for reference to a designated term ( choose from a selection box ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¤ e is used for defining the font size . it can be set to specify the font size for the main text , the feet notes , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand .
the brackets after the \ \ document@@ class command contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font file . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the press of a button .
the source text must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for storing it automatically .
if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . if it is not the case , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be noted .
an environment ( eng@@ l environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few sli@@ ts should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then be the modification of the fon@@ ts within the environment to turn away ( eng@@ l . Hu@@ ge ) .
the changes are only secured inside the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c print and is available until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex and mark@@ up language is displayed , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box is now followed .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do so , a quote , a few passages in fat and intensive print and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be converted back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI @-@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some computer drivers . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are needed ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using file print@@ ings ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows converting the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex , source code has been created , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ search query allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern can set up under Settings box ... Tools construction should be selected .
to search for the pre @-@ selection search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on the search query . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then made .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ cul@@ ation ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error in using the &amp; DVI prompt , there may be an error . if there is a bug , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file lists the source code error source . in the editor , the buttons on La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between errors . the log file always displays the line in which the error appears . to view the incorrect line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line .
once you click on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , see the section below .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; box ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file will be opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can set up in Settings box ... Settings Gener@@ alities are set .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering a document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ entary class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex files . if an easy way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and read the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility to read and emphasize many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
the manual for Kate should be used to find out more about and its possibilities . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with the reading of the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with cli@@ ck@@ able C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ big@@ skip will be \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for the most different types of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex works differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can include additional diving marks . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries do not include jumping marks or the corresponding keyboard . this is also highlighted by the jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a sign .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; Even though &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent opportunities offered in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; essential functions for selecting a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Select , the following commands are included for the text selection :
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning would include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only prev@@ ent@@ able thing in &amp; box ; is that the sli@@ ts are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also he@@ als &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a reverse layer ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for listening to a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the button Del@@ ete ; offers the key root C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove are the following commands to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit Environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environmental commands , you can quickly get lost . this command will conclude the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environmental structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are defined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is located in front of or behind the sc@@ aled bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , the group is inj@@ ected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted cur@@ ly groups brackets can be quickly lost . this command completes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple instructions are used in &amp; box ; for the appropriate implementation it is used in &amp; box ; the character is used for two simple instructions . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and holds two complete instructions for &amp; lat@@ ex .
this automatic entry of the double application mark can set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use foreign @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ rus or French ) and therefore German or French instructions . there are also many other languages available .
if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; box ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a spread@@ sheet environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with an adjacent line breaks .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings box ; Set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to assign columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t @-@ notes ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to achieve this . while drum@@ ming Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line .
although &amp; Po@@ sts ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are built . all these modes can be configured for different work modes under Settings box ...
when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command &amp; box ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , in most cases , the list is enlarged . on the other hand , the list can also be sc@@ aled down by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions is possible using the Edit pad N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est jumping record and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings box ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Modification can be made to these lists . there can be different registry lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ r of the general language used .
command mode is not needed for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call to complete stand@@ by mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , environments are so often used that &amp; box ; a special mode for completing environments .
when invo@@ king the complete environment or key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button can be stopped .
once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings box ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Modification can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of complete defense modes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of barriers that can immediately be replaced by more strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le Complete Works . as an example of a cooling list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is used , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the Men@@ u@@ Edit Ver@@ Compl@@ eted termination or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space key , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ r are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written more than once in a document .
this mode can set up in the menu settings box ... Ki@@ le can be switched off . here , the threshold value can also be specified for displaying the violation .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to review the basics about the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but they offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed in groups in the menu Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating and Gener@@ ating View .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer as well as ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and used by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Building instruction , a viewer is usually called after the compilation . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... here the following information is asked for the project :
when defining the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ p project file .
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet finished and can be added to other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
the first thing to say is that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a very sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages included and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / ly@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database of all documents and for a graphical surface .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is extracted from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day you use different signatures , as with random signatures , you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . signature : Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click on the Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove in the File Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar .
you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short order , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the bottom right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ mail ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mail , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how superior it is . if we add a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects an inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book folder in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time I am started .
as already said , everyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is defective . please check the reported bug and try again .
if the file to be checked already marks in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ For@@ med , click the Well @-@ For@@ med verification selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , they choose &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; for both the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG verification is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also one &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then they can easily be selected . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . normally , the file is stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which are &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; spaw@@ n , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone uses the code in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location are used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often , several people work in a hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other in a project . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears bold according to which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something particular happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
you can either select the comment entry from the Editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , with the nick@@ name of the top name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Leader .
nick@@ names and roll names are in@@ sensitive to upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Groß / Klein@@ elling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the tags are inserted in the same way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ elling means the attributes are inserted in the same way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
automatically close optional tags : if attached , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this will be added immediately after &amp; gt ;
automatically close not optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags .
automatically update start and end day : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic sub@@ stitution of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during inser@@ ting .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of various types of files . restore the standard settings using the Def@@ ault button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is sto@@ cked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not detected . however , this setting is sto@@ cked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power ou@@ tage or crash . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or a separate view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . regards the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action makes it possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of node is set in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change the structure tree should be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , whereas empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the clause exclu@@ des anything else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here , the plu@@ gins can be managed . plu@@ gins are K@@ Part applications from third @-@ party , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts generally refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct . selecting allows saving the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger was dis@@ continued , as well as support for db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented which allows different implement@@ ations of plu@@ gins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ et ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plu@@ gins in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in drop @-@ in drop @-@ off , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger is made , if necessary , or tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Start the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . output of this request is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger version .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if a de@@ bug started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to variable variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a request is given , the execution will begin once a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include it will be properly cleaned .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there is no current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set to set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
document Type edit packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the Script Langu@@ ages and / CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic links of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details for conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without risk of a write error .
tag files are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but element type about itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the type of tag class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source texts used to fill the attributes in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cut and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag name % , meaning the name of the current tag .
a container tag that summari@@ zes the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end one day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a frac@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above is in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; start window and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as fairly simple and there is an editor for it at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Ver@@ turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... to create . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button symbol assigned to this action . by clicking on the user button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the Det@@ a@@ ili@@ erten settings and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on it it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts local script folder : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / is removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above @-@ listed methods , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to the default input . in the sel@@ ector input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output . it can be specified what is to happen with the text written to the default output by setting the value the selection box output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the check@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog if available , so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ menu ; , graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose editing size to others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually labeled as loose , starting , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user signals that clicking this icon is a &amp; lt ; star@@ t@@ gt ; tag in the current document .
after creating the icon , it has to be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the action you want . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared this to a better overview by some separ@@ ator into several groups . open the tool@@ bar and adjust dialog about settings tool bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
after selecting the element to add to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to make sure everything works .
back up in the correct folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html ...
the Tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit to the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder appears ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to form context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply by $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( just as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that this is good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not get rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . in different places there is an email send with email , send tool bar tool@@ bars with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a final contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource pass the input fields ( URL Pre@@ view can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , high load tool bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , inqu@@ ire &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please read the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format might be necessary . there is a simpler way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
destination name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defini@@ tions : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to draw full use of qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is marked as global , is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ gli@@ zes the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Editor window , the tree view , the divi@@ ders with info and the tool@@ bars . please hit in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing , relo@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jumping to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document .
rect@@ angles in the Editor area lead to another context menu related to the edited document content , such as editing / copying / past@@ ing , editing the tag under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , using the word under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or opening the file if the string under the mouse poin@@ ter calls a file .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional serves as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; in your document , then click the icon representing the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog .
the building man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ) enable to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate them , open them and ro@@ am . in the representation with divi@@ ders are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed .
a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information into a script . by clicking with the right mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her the tree opens .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ ia can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system based on the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two car@@ ts at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and you will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an E@@ Mail , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is in the PA@@ TH in front of their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , what already someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detail documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
convert special characters to &amp; HTML for inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script will issue error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and switching of the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the icon column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of a mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
creates a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it only creates the name . actions must be saved using Settings actions ... Edit tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows you to upload tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access them . see in .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; who has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one . this record is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu points above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the tag ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window to / off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
speci@@ fies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; posters ; find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and change the sequences .
this should generate a help corresponding to the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter &apos;s surroundings , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project , e.g. after completing the project name . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file will be filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exe ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host &apos;s settings , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
be attached when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started from scratch , not hook .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder , and you can make a detailed selection of good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the Project Properties menu in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings are similar to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card holders possible ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case the de@@ bu@@ gging is described .
high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set in the sub@@ window profiles as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by indicating its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can switch event actions and add , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . it is not possible to influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select project ... from the Menu Project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders will behave as well , but the opening and opening records are missing ... in the context menu call@@ able with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by the user . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before upload .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ profile profiles can be created and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but anyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be a lot of views in one project , i.e. by simply di@@ pping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted in the Project tool@@ bar &apos;s menu or the project tool bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps boost productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best stack@@ able above the tool@@ bar menu . use and add are different . adding tool@@ bars is treated at the bottom of the Add tool bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be adjusted either using context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions like tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame , or tool@@ bars can be executed , where you can specify which actions to be visible on these or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set Settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or merge any existing directory into the template tree .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in template tree under global templates .
documents can be created by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in template tree among global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save As local template save ....
once this has been done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save choice as local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and dropping or inser@@ ting over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file , select a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can submit head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or link files . additionally , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / utilities .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and applies to everything except the root folders in the template table . if a root folder would be set in such a way , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a root folder .
allows a previous or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and by copying content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
additionally you have a context menu ( to indicate right mouse button ) about a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor available through the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL editor functions as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back when required to the source editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the V@@ PL &apos;s default . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes in the source text editor and the V@@ PL editor are visible and the cur@@ sor is running synchron@@ ously in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor . pressing F@@ 9 is already active , the push of the button moves the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization gap between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small span for fast hosts and a large range for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools can be selected . thus , editing invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL editor is created . this is used to reduce the de@@ coding of the V@@ PL editor . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click in the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ les@@ he@@ et by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
use of cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processor , due to moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculi@@ arly . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the button or removed button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , needs to be removed each other An@@ chor Tag .
some tool@@ bars like the spread@@ sheet assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists have to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style sheet can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , you need lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
support in a template , in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned fixing points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path@@ name . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age named QNAP or a given model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired holding point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this will be executed automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll down on / off using the arrow keys to the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; is set .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid template that exists only from the ASCII character 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system of the user . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ hei@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white signs . later , a lot more useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and mim@@ ic the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed promin@@ ently . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble when someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ from files .
if all the files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make typing work easier by fully writing the file name of the first file . example :
fol@@ dable folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open Di@@ alogue enables manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders is introduced . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
when combined , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting to merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open Di@@ alogue you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large amount of effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , drag them into &amp; past@@ 3 ; load them and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste , and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can do nothing out &amp; scratch ; pull out . only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the character A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one sees the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) .
in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in rare , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file doesn &apos;t have lines . if the line breaks enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison window ) also has an info line with the write output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you edit the result . usually it contains text by automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must also be solved manually at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also include a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes , no more line is left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps yet again choose another source . this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; conflicts of merge ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this feature .
note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navigate primarily with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , bottom , side , side , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other keys to edit . by using the add button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l image ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; all non @-@ resolved conflicts are still considered a conflict even after manual resolution .
to copy the cli@@ p@@ board to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and eliminating manual copying . be careful with this option , as you may accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
new@@ lines are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line @-@ end of the source files , so you should not use &amp; past@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of most recently used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; Set Def@@ ault ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width for selection , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be shown ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically create an un@@ just color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is checked , any selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . you will then no longer need to copy the manual to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart track sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ side comparison look identical , though they are different . if this option is checked , this option may be disabled . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will appear before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , use better the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and mer@@ ging a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backing .
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must &amp; scratch ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for coding appears a short note , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted . because coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to use for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn this down to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore dig@@ its or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color coded transition column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ hei@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly suits your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processor command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . each input line has to have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program that by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ing to convert the input into upper case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a true expression of the characters found in a row . the \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in upper@@ case . the \ \ U converts the found text in capital letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line reconciliation requires $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ enting with sed you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line devi@@ ations@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so practically deleted .
sometimes you might want to do several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the composition . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Gener@@ ating / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs only a few details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . subsequent operations only change the data that the line @-@ like algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that hides text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the mer@@ ging and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify the folders on the command line or in the dialog File .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as the base . if no destination folder has been specified , the folder will be used as a destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow )
while reading the folder , you will inform a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared will be listed .
when the scanning of the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ click on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories open and all sub@@ directories open up to which you can open all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison starts and it appears a comparison window .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the plug @-@ in action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is identical even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . with folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying of B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and if the option synchron@@ izes directories active . then select &amp; k@@ disper@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; past@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then examine &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggest the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .
while mer@@ ging , one file will be executed after the other . it status column displays skill when mer@@ ging was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected as full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all plug @-@ in actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der @-@ merge mode C is used as a target , with the two @-@ folder merge , B is selected as the target and when syn@@ cing A and / or B is used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all the entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options ski@@ pped through the particular entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / resume in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select the start / resume directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to determine the cause of the problem . if you continue mer@@ ging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed to merge .
if some entries have been individually compiled , these entries ( in the current session ) will not merge again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this can be set up folder specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a pre@@ defined point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the Element@@ tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
with links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links display . this is down@@ lighted in default .
for links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to a continuous loop and &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders to a slow network , it might be faster to compare the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . the results of mer@@ ging files are also stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is the knowledge provided that the other file was not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and preserves the extension .@@ orig@@ . When an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not just mer@@ ging entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the folder merge view is visible while mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to , you can turn the option folder &amp; text window into the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ click . nevertheless , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly , without first having to run the folder merge . to do this , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again when you start folder mer@@ ging .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re@@ inv@@ ading
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty strings &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link is pointing to a file or a folder . then a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference be@@ holder in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first starts the built @-@ in difference be@@ holder . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference be@@ holder and then select in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally you need &amp; past@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; specify that the input file is a patch file in the unified format . then starts &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; then starts &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now available ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by st@@ ressing in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or that they will go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ war@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the rest of this , is often the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort required for this was too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !

cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift past@@ ing ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update button after changes to these options . )
this also causes identical files to be copied when mer@@ ging . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual working surfaces . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ space , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within a desktop and at multiple .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and ending . if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on the icon and the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and exit .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when clicking on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when clicking on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
if this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled along with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , all virtual working surfaces appear in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with their contents and move . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use with &amp; K@@ mag ; use a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact amount of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impairment .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you &amp; K@@ mag ; launch , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . below , this window is referred to as a magni@@ fying window . the picture shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can get a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop mode mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press &amp; shift ; press button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop displaying the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the Update Rate ( Very Low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your typ@@ ed short commands to store files , open a new window , print , relo@@ ad ( with the button document relo@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impairment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ sist for a while at the same point . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter har@@ nesses a while at the same point . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click em@@ ulate pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
in order to make it clear again : even if the c@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for each .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can execute pulling with pressed mouse button .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings out .
if Intelli@@ gent Move is enabled , the turn@@ around time ( 1 / 10 s ) is enabled . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is done .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ bo@@ .@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler sound buffer , which you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later use the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease with sounds .
first , you should be aware of where a mouse click is without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not make a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse @-@ mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you view the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks out the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . however , park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . this way , an accidental moving of the mouse can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent drive , but I don &apos;t make it possible to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to select text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move when you just start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use this instead : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move time starts with intelligent delay . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and they are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ sist . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to the afflicted .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag process to begin before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent user can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course phrases that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text box . from the text passages you can select often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right @-@ hand screen@@ shot ) you determine the word addition dictionary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary so that only properly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word addition .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard hub of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a storage memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have frac@@ tured , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the word addition page as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card voice output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding with which the text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your speech generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that &apos;s successful , further settings are ignored on this page . kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text passages or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Message , the selected text passage is spoken directly and added in addition to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down menu of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text box should be saved automatically when the processing window is closed .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text box directory will not be saved . choose Save Save , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text box should be saved .
the word addition page contains a list of dictionary words for the word addition . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box when this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the drop @-@ down box the language for the dictionary .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read &amp; paste ; the frequency of individual words is easily determined by counting the assignment . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert just written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can sum@@ mar@@ ise the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are sum@@ mar@@ ised and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option add a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; adding new words to the dictionary automatically create a dictionary with your vocabulary over the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books can be accessed either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the exp@@ iry date .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected portions of the exp@@ iry date .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ iry date .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not enabled , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a mov@@ able bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed above the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for the speech output correctly or not . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the word@@ list . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
festival is a speech edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line to set up the speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA to be used free of charge for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / Ji@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :

the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard voice output interface . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which is displayed in the &amp; k@@ mouth installation dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the speech generator ) , but it depends on the detail of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can print text through the computer . it stores a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always re@@ write again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service that allows each application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers are ready to use which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS skills .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; , even if &amp; plac@@ e. in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded .
speech output is carried out using the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows to create language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

before you can use it , you need to install and correct program speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . see also
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the Kar@@ tei@@ map speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the Kar@@ tei@@ map General will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher will otherwise use the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printer spo@@ ilers for the same printer .
if you click on the tab speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the Kar@@ tei@@ map speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all speakers already set up will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of a mouse , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the font General and check whether to activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the font list orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language distribution system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the cart card orders will be displayed and you can create text orders and read . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field of speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , pause , pause and resume .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the car@@ tei@@ map orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab General and check out Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text to be read before , and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible stamps are also pre @-@ read .
in &amp; Sche@@ dule ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; then you can read text displayed . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text to be read before , and select text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works when &amp; posters ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de message system , noti@@ fying you of events that have been specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read more .
in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de , you can set up various types of messages . for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name is present . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters text is processed before it is sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the output of the warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you send from the Kar@@ tei@@ map orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads , this output is stopped and ended .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre @-@ defined set @-@ chain filters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a more intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ml .
with speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example on the Kar@@ tei@@ Map Spo@@ kes@@ person , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters set up . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the further below are displayed .
you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern to set up character sets . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged against the associated sub@@ text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must be distinguished only by the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Er@@ bet column .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key when you click the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may just type copied .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions agree with an entry in the Sli@@ ding filter box if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character chain replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package box .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PA@@ TH environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the Kar@@ tei@@ Map Spo@@ kes@@ person , or to a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text over@@ comes to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics that the program suggests , and selected the characteristics of the speaker set up on the Kar@@ tei@@ map . with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter , you can over@@ write the speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can access them with a click on the button to get help at the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text ful@@ fills the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the right button to display the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to store or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the Sli@@ de filter box if you apply . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , which allows program@@ mers to give T@@ TS skills to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; console ; windows . start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; XML ; forming filter , but when using the module for festival web@@ pages are not read .
due to a mistake in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so S@@ able is working at all . you also need to do that if you don &apos;t use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ ries . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a character chain replace filter .

the list of languages listed above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that is not yet contained in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand to use another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the XML conversion filter , but is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ vil@@ s or downloaded the tar@@ ball that is currently available each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , first check if the speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . for this you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can go back to sentence or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application passes text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used otherwise the best suitable speaker will be selected . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , look in .
if you click on the Car@@ tei@@ Map Spo@@ kes@@ person on Add , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the flash@@ card Spe@@ aker Setup will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown in the following . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in the case of voices , which are known , this setting will be done automatically . in general , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you set volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few kno@@ bs and this grey is displayed , the voice that you choose will not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on Apply ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the symbol in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the precisely processed sentence .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed to or back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it is either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ 1 % equivalent to about half and 200@@ W ; % approximately twice the normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this tab you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech requests :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications .
check this check box to turn on &amp; check . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications on which a sound is played are not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent if someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that is displayed in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the forward noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voice , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ L is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ L only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the default voice used in the edition of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ lt ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! Doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech synthesis / Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can be faster with reading , since only the first set can be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other set of rules recognition filters , beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speech selection by selecting it . switch on the choice of speakers , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ats ; select . turn on the speaker selection , change some features , and check how the choice of the speaker is changed .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then stop or cancel orders on the Kar@@ tei@@ map , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the standard limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit@@ ers compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages , or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the standard limit recognition filter from default , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the tab speaker ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the properties of an equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , choose the speaker . otherwise , choose the speaker , which most likely matches the original set @-@ up .
select the method to enter the desired language properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
mark this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also place multiple marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in the distribution of the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker , which is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .

I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows not this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ pin / vocals add the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some Synthes@@ izer modules like Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read .

before you start , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions delivered with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software at festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ® synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; it produces the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ vocals and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this by &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
for this procedure additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , which enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the Network Set@@ ting module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing &amp; installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release date . selecting non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries can be made permanent . the next start of the network settings will then be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , which means the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . this is divided into three riders :
the Ri@@ der Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the Ri@@ der Network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings shown on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automati@@ cally , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are executed at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection Man@@ ually can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . switching on an off @-@ off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
speci@@ fies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as a standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be added to top priority by selecting an entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list .
by pressing the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . then the entry is inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit button ....
the list Nam@@ ely familiar computer describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list includes some familiar computers some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple Ali@@ as names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit your calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , you have to set the following command in a &amp; console .
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second part all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , changing configuration files will be discussed .
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are run with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point , which ha@@ stens a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own host ) . the default route is required for the IP relay .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections so it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections there is another content than fixed there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected may therefore occur .

recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the default , searches for the matching index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been inserted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding out the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ection of the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting by &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , it must be format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the belt name and capacity , proceed with the format of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically included and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files listed in the profile are backed up .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save File menu ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or the folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , you need to mark the files that are to be recovered . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for the restoration .
if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog appears again . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ generate the index to two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a security profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders which are listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be listed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
exec@@ uting an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new sn@@ apshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ; &amp; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , send &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated the command will load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the release of &amp; k@@ dat is automatically ej@@ ected ; automatically disc@@ ard the tape . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ rich block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n by@@ te ) The band ID . the format of this sequence is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the volume has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the volume was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives , which can be handled directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and analyze the protocol files of certain programs .
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ ed@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens , instead of its a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely you don &apos;t have permission to read the protocol under Linux in the / var / log file , for which normal user usually does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip to filter out a selected criterion or string . the list of the log @-@ lines will now be changed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed to match the selected filter . in the default setting , the selection field contains the entry All . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then only matched with entries in the corresponding column . for example , select the column process in the protocol file system log , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color than protocol lines of the level Note . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you only want to display a specific process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip .
in addition , you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ s.@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. This site provides you with more up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ ent@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion repository : k@@ ent@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for checking the program start when running the system in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I won &apos;t go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and re@@ format . so you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc rather than directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to start when the system starts up or when you switch to another run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such stuff as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port when you start up .
the kernel looks in@@ it at various points after the program and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning area :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can fix it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does all the right scripts start ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder there are no proper files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts from hand on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when it contains a K , the script is called up with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; quot ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ levels or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you extract an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you move them to a new range . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already been in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection ober@@ - or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another running level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; running at Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like eg , Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit without a message when their configuration files are not present or incor@@ rectly set up .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears to the dialog user or group properties .
some maps are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space limitations ( quota ) for users , a card card is created by which you can make individual adjustments . other flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD UNIX .
the password management card will appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD UNIX .
this card only appears if for at least one integrated file system footprint ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space restrictions are in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with space limitation .
the tab group informs about the group members of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or Del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group functions similarly .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change boot password , change time to boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
