<seg id="1">The module website can be translated in & konqueror; -menu under Extras website. select from the drop-down list the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated in place of the entire URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations don't make important decisions depending on the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated into the Babelfish page by themselves, where you can paste texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions, see & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; select Add extensions... Open the flashcard tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings modules from the kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on extras crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle filter (also called Folder Filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Angle filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentitem, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for different symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in representing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportionate to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected even when they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always respected. it will be drawn frame to represent the nesting of entries, and those boxes need space, which is then lost to the subordinate entries. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry is done for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. hereby, it is always advantageous for labelling and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally represented area for an entry above the menu item view Antaining to area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image gallery can be found in & konqueror; -menu under Extras... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the gallery image gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotational field to adjust the number of mini pictures of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">The file name of the image shows whether the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">Show the file size check box to see if the file size is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">Display the image size check box to determine if the size of the images is shown below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save in HTML file, specify where to store the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">By accessing sub-folders with the check box, you can set a slider to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied into the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you want to use the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings offers easy access to the general & HTML; -settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in & konqueror; -menu under Tools HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The Media Playback for the navigation area can be found in & konqueror; View menu under window navigation pane, or with the key shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror, which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only to certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browsing id of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that does not deny access to this browser, change browser recognition to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the identifier in MSIE for pages that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browsing detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes, are correctly represented with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the Insert menu item... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digicam; albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gPhoto2 library. of course, any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicam; easy to use, dozens of professional skills are available. it works complete in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digicam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report.... This opens a dialog with a submerged connection. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error report system. all required information is already registered here. follow only the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digikam; then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list from & digikam. however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful of this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get started & digicam; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. guide to report in the developer mailing list from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edit; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply insert path names or click on the Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data collection is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digiously set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the topmost folder, which contains images, as base folder. & edited; view each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durring recursively the library path in its full depth. you can not exclude any subfolders unless it is iste in hidden folders. this can be done by adding a point in front of the folder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenpop do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and discarding it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can go to & digicam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, & digicam; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported video cameras in the Help Menu Help.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digicam; albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gPhoto2 library. of course, any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 supports also Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos in general are large files and commits over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">LibgPhoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read thumbnails. if the exif support is not present in libgPhoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digicam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digicam; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digicam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; or switch to F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal partition line or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus filtering on the filename only works if it is displayed in symbol view. which fields can be displayed you can configure in the dialog of the AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were recorded on the disk, after the name of their collection in the Albencharacteristics or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have a scanner installed, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose album Import images scan to do so. you can also add a screenshot to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you collection is used to sort your photos, or sort albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, Average, New Years: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the section of the album. to do this, first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & digitin, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you then want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, select the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports key words for single photos in the area My key word list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will display the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the pictures will be displayed in this album in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you must wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recreate thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the preview. what information these are can be edited via Settings. select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help buttons that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all it's happening at & digikam. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. you can reach all the features with & digicam; you can reach all the features with & digicam; you have the choice between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open image processing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... select. in the edited editing pane, you will find a guide on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & edited; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. to this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur. some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview button and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & edited, it is moved to the garbage bins of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del if you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Date Light & quot; organizes your photos based on the data. & quot; uses either the EXIF date or if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the picture gallery. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the data view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. you can also organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My key word button; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the image data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords will be re-imported when the database is lost, as soon as the images are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking on & quot; My sampling & quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu As an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use & edit the functionality with keyword, you first have to put your photos with keyword. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can also click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keywords.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of words. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, this will be displayed in the main window while previewing the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword by right-clicking on the context menu of the photo and selecting Remove from the menu menu. the menu will show you only the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view displays a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved through this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, datestamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again. if the search did not find anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can search this search here as a live search, which always filter what you entered as a search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the results will be displayed in the My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after search again, you just have to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search, the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select Add as Advanced Search, the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search. here you find more rules for searching. for more information, see the Advanced search tool.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields from & digi.exe; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules will be added to this list with search group / search group. any option can be associated with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one. if you slide a picture from somewhere beyond the symbol of inaccurate search in the left side bar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right images. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it. move it while you pull the left mouse button. all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this will then be added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image data formats, including raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened. if you are in & digibox again; main windows are, you can quickly open the light table using L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window. if you select preview from the toolbar and execute Zoo or cropping operations on one of the pictures, then they are also executed with the other image. so you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a series of pictures. if you navigate pairing mode from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to compare it. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it on the left. this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal deletion actions also work directly out of the light table such as F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivelling feature that you can see on the crossed arrows. to change the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; press preview and then both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom function works just like in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos picks up, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up, find, protect, and re-use your images. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers who have & digiaded; use. we will focus on downloading, renaming, removing, converting, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; digital stock management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find a certain photo without stock management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely do not use & digicam;. the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files ensures very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you install anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files need to be organized somehow on your computer. you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly through your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, such as versioning of photos, archiving, work sequences, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the metadata settings page. this ensures EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to do so, & digikam; to give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos while working.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now deal with keywords, keywords, as well as other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then it becomes & digikam; automatically set the tree for you or simply insert the pictures in the right place. changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different meta-data intersect. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data refer to properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream of associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help him understand the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work with a label on its own.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even put it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides you a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will not tell you a second time for publishing.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with images the train of the spatial presentation now moves with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities offered by geolocation are innumerable and will be even deepening in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographic indications. & nbsp; can also export kml files you can export with GoogleMaps. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the direction page of & digikam; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">This field contains the name of the photographer. examples can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, this must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright-sections, although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculators can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, plate failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disasterPrevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery agency, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated cautiously and you may not be trusted for more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are deals on gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which claims a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged diskettes, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is, of course, also valid for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. after that, read the media with a description, date & author and then stored on a clean, dark dry and protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives for this subject:</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason for SMART. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. some of SMART-defined errors indicate the imminent failure. this is in particular read errors and storage counters. the expected lifetime amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be restored without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical appliances do not make a lot of electrical shocks, it looks different for devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause serious damage. so on your computer, these anomalies can cause distorted keyboards, complete data loss, hardware alteration, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember, however, not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed especially for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. some models even allow them to continue working until the current runs again. if you purchase a UPS, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of current disruptions with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in the case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 a year you get unlimited storage, which should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs keep at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer. nobody seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they create interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">Sun Microsystems ZFS seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its blower filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms used by the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% on the workstation systems. notebooks are already 50% of the share of theft.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. meaning that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result, the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so make no other responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so secure your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous, such as reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or resizing disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash strikes you are lucky if the drive wasn't connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget airplane accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss in spite of fuse the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential locking.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync merely copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after saving them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot of each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC saved in the image file, associated XMP files, original storing, storage, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the time in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variations you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have budgeted the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been detected by the system, but don't append it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBb; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollars; resize2fs / dev / sdc # modifies the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF is stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obligated to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provides DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block & quot; technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; which stands for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP matches this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include working on an architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections, and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera screen, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digicam; edit, then you should add metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright using a digital watermark. only export them in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edit; in the addition of a photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. for more description, see the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it is trying to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a fermenting indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not provide thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application of any file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the required selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download Selected. the button Selected can be downloaded until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New can be downloaded. until now, these images have not been downloaded from & digi.In this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums is displayed in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is shown in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once, by deleting the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, then you must first select it and delete erased deletion.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully review if the photos were successfully added to a & edited; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do this about the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use meaningful names as filenames for the photos. the file names are normally reused after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate file names if you load photos of different recording files into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based subalbums. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the commit opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data to the author in the Standard Auto Identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the default format, you can, for example, use the prefix photo% y-%% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. to do so, turn on the option Date & Time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digikam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Metadata, you can read more details about the information your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, it can be downloaded; use this to automatically load subalbums in the target album. all images with the same date will be loaded into the same subfolder. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Meta data you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually disabled, and in this case, the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the Date-based subverbs at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, ask & digikam; you know where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or simply want to document the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card references. the question is actually more about how the data comes into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, about a follow-up of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must store this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data from pictures and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; tries to give you so much control over his work flows as possible. to access these settings, you need to edit settings in the Settings menu; select set up. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be displayed on a saved preview or start image processing. you place the default behavior of & digikam; note if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's title: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. these can be designations such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of other & quot; Providenquot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image, and not only in the digicode database; and this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digicam; imported without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image descriptions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the inscriptions embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests on a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The brightness of & quot; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the light table these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; you should only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can disable the toolbar if you are using image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light colour in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this mode of view can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG Compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, as PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file compression option, you can switch the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect image quality, since the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the loss-ease setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was just an image viewer for photos. at present, it is very fast becoming a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">If you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that under exposed pictures you get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the spotlights, so the parts of your images are burned, because of the inability of your camera to capture the spotlights as a transparent white. use the setting to solve some unusual results as they show the spotlights in various pink tones. finally, you can try some parts of missing information from the top lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the reconstructions option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digicam; image processing. to keep the time for Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial-raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provides you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD-Interpolation. after some tests it looks like that. VNG-Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color variance of your lens, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction as it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information like the color information from one color space to translate to the other are thus the colors to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Sets here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC Profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures and does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color tonal mapping or gammakeperture. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must perform the tonal mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile, which allows you to emulate how your picture would be restored by a device. this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors so you can adjust manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a set of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and these will be downloaded from & digi.These modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjust the time between the image transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn on or off the metadata that appears at the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the frame display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you select a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / image, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digicam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera, which is displayed in the menu of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the garbage bins, you can adjust the conversation of & edit; when deleting a photo in an album. in the clipping of a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be tacitly used by & digicam; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without reviewing. otherwise, you need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also read & edit the display of the welcome screen. this speeds under certain circumstances, accelerates the start-up of & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When you start looking for new photos forces & digikam; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, queries & digikam; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & dialog; use to customize the main window to suit your taste. you can select these settings in Settings design from the toolbar. previewing the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; find out more about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the entry Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your picture before you change it. you can do this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or the button The Restore of image processing Restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done on the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be undone or recovered. the last action can be undone by modifying or restoring working from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press a moment longer via the return or restore button in the toolbar, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same Album or the same keyword, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in toolbar or entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen display displays the photo in full screen mode. you will be displayed in the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can edit this in the Settings dialog. if you do not want to, you can view this in the Settings dialog. see the section for setting up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image from the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases. you just have to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export assistant. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is, without the navigational arrows, also available in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or paste labels with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata adjustment that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC-field Urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword index shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the key word tree, and a selection box with the keywords used in this & edited.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is applied only to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a sample with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, - date, keyword and search results is used. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays images on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off using Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an advanced search on all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked on & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner are a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, colour management means making informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. additionally, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image output is by e-mail or the web where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why do you have to use another color space to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB comparison in comparison with the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, then visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellente page and then click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to install my monitor if I have decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to crystallize your monitor because sRGB sounds that your; onitor works on sRGB. if you are working as a sRGB colour space, you must either crystallize your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Conducting Automatic Correction are trying to make the best out of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the luminance values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest dot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Counterbalance: this method mimics the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparision produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Amplify contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a revision of all values in-between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a little limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. if you can be too far from the original image areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your chances of correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the image below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right, a histogram is shown that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load keys do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set you can save to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also create another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonal mapping can be performed by the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter Color Administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to save them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool to gradation that you will find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiaded; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when exposed to a partially developed pressure of a short flash light. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neon light. for large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to adjust the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photo. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too great saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog on this tool is very complicated, you only need the scope of the slider for the purpose described here. concrete the three slide below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or selected range. under the graph, three slide valves are clicked into the window and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box you can choose whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle notes, often called gammages.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpoints can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to modify the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create an extended image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and reloaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp Levels Format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three color pipettes, the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the entries of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short section to the right, e.g. the light tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you created can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp Curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipette buttons, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun tones. turn on the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer der & digikam; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Select the color for the histogram with the channel selection box: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The image preview has a red marker. when you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to keep Luminance, the image will also retain the overall brightness, as the channel blender then is THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color. colored consists of small noise files that do not appear on the same spot in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save and load any mixer setup for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film reel profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panther Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scenes and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellowish filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and re-development in a sepipe. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicam; tool texture you can apply decorative textures on one image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the strewn eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. round the picture with a colored line, Niepce finishes it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), decanted it with a nice three dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: the width of the frame is in percent. the range of value for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The pattern decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the "OK" button. once the picture has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; tool template you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Schablone menu applies in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compressing (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template, simply send an email in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil file with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Once the root folder has been set for templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears. selecting a folder will automatically update the template's preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to shrunk the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produced especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it does not work a bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitalisation process colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera has often been used internal sharpness. however, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of focus while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness index. you can call this with the menu item Corrigidly Field.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this, since the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will refocus the tool. you can focus on more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to mark softeners with the menu entry Correcy soft markers and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates are generated near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpest pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image one of the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference-amount. this can be used to define a minimum difference in order for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the notes are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example for the blurry masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurry masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving sharpness. it used the copyrighted defling filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique to sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus usually achieves better results than blurry mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circle-shaped folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß's fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your blur is Gauß. this is most often caused by a previously performed blur filter. in most cases, you should drop this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value of nonzero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. however, please note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Maskieren produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by harming masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks always have to create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Viennese filter, it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the field correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing knob blends the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinted colour allows an adapted colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to make the restoration easier. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is subsequently necessary. please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a movie basket or CCD rouches, a high value wave-like pattern will generate. JPEG artefacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above allel. p then defines the relative smoothing. hence, set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load keys do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image defects is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and require a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button abort.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image defects with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller mistakes are adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch to the front looking for luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or blacksmier occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more obscured, but also greases the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the adjustment of the phase damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter will appear on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction is applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to mark softeners with the menu entry Correcy soft markers and experiment with the smooth. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artactequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load keys do exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and require a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected unter (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the poor pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the button darken. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the preview preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and reload it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a one-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel are drawn to compute a bi-quadratic surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the broken pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo formats, often cannot illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 with aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since there would otherwise be blur effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a CenterFilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker's copyright.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing of an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu colour gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flaws on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, distortion-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth. this value appears more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils the 'Corner parameter has the reversed insignia of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size, resulting in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image shrinks.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightening: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion parameter. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonne or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would obviously be the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformers trimming from image processing or via the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the sound-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown in (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red tape of the GimplicGuru.org website that can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 infrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters to set cinematography and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film, the ISO knob changes the amount of film grain and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO levels generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the makers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value, although higher values are required, can be set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiaded; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life-life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smoothes 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you chose to sketch yourself.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">It uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important at the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monstroy landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom: blurs the image along star-shaped lines that radiate from one center point. this simulates the blur of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurs the image by rotating the pixels at a central point. this simulates the blur of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurs the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement blur: blurs the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographed, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurs the image softly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking: blurs the image due to random shift of the pixels and thus simulates the blur of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: find the color pool in the picture and blur it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your images a wet appearance. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicam; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen film. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools for this can be found in the Transformer Dreaming / Transformer Spider menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many imaging programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm image bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any insertion for photo can be saved as text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take very long and move a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by magnifying a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to cut a photo you simply have to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rectangle. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply clicking with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save file or save file in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool after aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait mode, the greater value of height and in the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the composition help make it possible to blend aids in order to better compose your pictures. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a way to share a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads to the viewer's view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. its vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals on these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect of dynamic symmetry called dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the objects rotate around an angle. you can do this with the & digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the turn is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function transformers trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically cutting feature. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image after the turn. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. you will then automatically recompute the preview. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly greased. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformers trimming out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The locking tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal pattern, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two insulation causes twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaling the image has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformers trimming out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; shows only files in formats to which knows. this is done by file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file is displayed in the image processing. you can change this list of file extensions.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, please read Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam. in the Configuration section, you will find more information on how to use modules with & digicam;.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to do the photo editing are included in & edited. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softening, noise reduction, refocusing, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you will see & quot; texture users quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image. on the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicate. the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally divided without duplicates. the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="716">In the Dialogue palette, you can select from a list of installed palettes or browse the folder after files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the colour next to it. the color is described under the palette view. here, the color name can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Beim Cursor is activated under the button color, the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor. the color is inserted either or overwrites another; depending on whether the mode overwriting was selected.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character, if another color follows.</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of the color selections can be drawn with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="724">Select a color anywhere on the screen and then you will find it in the color selector on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="725">& graphviz; is a KDE program used to view & graphviz; -dot; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, in particular in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; included are according to the program author obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphic viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph.The & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphic viewer; displays graphene with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & posters; re-calculate the graph and represent it in & kgraphic viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & posters; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphic viewer; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphic viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate subwindow. in the beginning, if you start & kgraphs; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list of Recently opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently in & kgraphic viewer; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphic viewer; can also remember your decision so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item settings kgraphic viewer; use it, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside of an ongoing & kgraphic viewer; eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphic viewer; instance or want to present the graphene to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice durably, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to divide the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph divided on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewal Load site gives the possibility to specify the behavior if a file has been modified on the disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & interviewer; to set a graph outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the current session) or determine that each time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphic viewers; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked for every start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears with one click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the & graphviz website are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered diagrams. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlappings as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unlighted graphene. it produces representations in accordance with the jump spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to a statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates a springboard model for non-layered graphene. it uses the Fruhman Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should accept the graphite file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change special options, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the particular type (dot; for directed, & neato; for unlighted graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module displays images to read new images and save them.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source like video streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry pictures, a dialog appears, which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer. select here the source you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default ducts in order to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image using the button Scan. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings might not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scanning, you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the image file. please remember that type BMP is not compressed and therefore produces very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screenshots can be created after you have selected in the Import folder &gt; Screen Picture... menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put the photos of your camera online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">When you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication, so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful login the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will see the dialog for upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exits to Flickr to Flickr two times, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current permissions that the module displays. currently, you need write permission. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button pictures should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, uploading photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as key words during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillie you can set the permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the option to change the size of the photos before upload, the photos will be changed before upload in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed to keep the aspect ratio unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlative. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. to run a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper variance for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no track data from one location for pictures, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location lies in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these boundaries here and then press the knob to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog moves the coordinates from one call to the next, you only have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. choose the region in question and enlarge it. always select this again until you reach a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a HTML page image gallery to version 4.01. you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is coded UTF-8 in order to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the preview preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture a new page will be created in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the default color depth. this naturally affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider's thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Rider for the preview pictures, these are small pictures that will be displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. he was developed for fast image display and quick access to his functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown as default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change pictures without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Digital Camera Client module is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list of kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then, select the picture you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please take a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a base image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD formats for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that, you can create the module via Extras mpeg slide show.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should choose the other settings. if you plan to reproduce the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that displays a picture. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg file. if possible, keep mpg as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, then this will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start the creation of the movie with the button code. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now enjoy a coffee quickly or in all peace and enjoy the slide show when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages above the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in the RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera maker. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information from your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, for example by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to convert all images into one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images in an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can scale or enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: no proportional scale change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo papers. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the pictures you previously selected. add more pictures using the button Add images. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures remove the selected pictures from the list of images to be sent away.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures you have selected are already attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't forget to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the pictures in a text file and the mail is added.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the picture file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and the original files in JPEG format, then original-export data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed so that you can view the status messages, searching for errors, but your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diashau, a window appears with questions like you want to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL Transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">"" "the option" "" "Show File names" "" "ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it using Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to randomly select images ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it does not use the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. the best distance, however, depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects that you can select. randomly, each transition between the images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date now has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your images and videos with comments, you can browse & photoalbum; through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images displayed on which both persons are to be seen. through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can mit & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which of course also applies to locations, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture above.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu you can choose which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage of allowing you to view the view for each category separately (if you don't have a suitable image for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual. to do this, you need to open the image-view window (described in more detail) and select the entry categories editor in the context menu. here you can customize the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can customize the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search window in the main window, a dialog is displayed, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you would like, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be a part of the total date, i.e., 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here you will see pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals but want to try out some functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & photoalbum; start the first time, or select in the menu Help the menu entry Kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & photoalbum; try it out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the time line. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this guide shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will show this date in the preview list) and also the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select an area, you will only see images of this time in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is included in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create through the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and goal. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the flash and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on a photoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kphotoalbum; export file to be created on the overview page. you will find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer on your site can change the resolution at any time you have set. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if you want to get a picture bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Please select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can verify that they are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages are created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you have to copy them manually. so the import function, see, properly works you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings above have all three related to base folders and URLs. in these settings, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & Kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time on the pictures, people on the pictures, recording location, etc. then you do not have to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file. the advantage of saving all the images into the file is that you can have all the pictures together and pass this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images twice. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file folder. if the appropriate images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for exporting images that you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">To copy the manual to the .kim file, copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & copy files to the .kim file with the Automatically option; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the option Export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying, for example, that each image should be at the most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File import... select, will import & Cphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, after that, in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the imported file (if you are a Dane) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the imported file to the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you see pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass the different steps of (1) setting up the information about your pictures, via (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual we talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. this is a simple XML file, which you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& Cphotoalbum; restores the folder in which your images are stored and used them automatically at future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; i.e. another folder tree with images, you can start & photoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry Settings Cphotoalbum; set up... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of & photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings options are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available that can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select an inscription and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up entire groups of members, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all group members as explained in a group.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& Cphotoalbum; shares his module system with other graphics applications, such as digicam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of & Kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules are tested with & photoalbum; only very little ones have been tested. therefore, you should always try new modules first with the demo database before you access them on your own pictures. demo database you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kPhotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & Kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums: an album is just a folder. even though & Kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order for some modules to make use of the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulating & photoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all the pictures that show you the preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, I have to pass a list of albums to the modules. here we go & photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you, for example, use the category people, & Cphotoalbum; so do so if you'd selected persons to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture, you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you & Kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain a lot of information as you do not yet have information about your pictures. in the section we will return to this window, now click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & photoalbum; is the possibility to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image is taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box, where you can specify people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the images inside the list. for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 people, you can, by doing so that the names used are moved up, the persons can find and assign them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the US. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the United States as a control group. to show you that it is an over-group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an item to a category and place it in order to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top of the frame. you can also make a separate window by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... button, which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the button Options... and then hide / hide the window. see this procedure in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you have not set a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Remove button, or select Edit menu in the Edit menu. now, you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Cphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use with & photoalbum; you can also use the images anywhere, so & Cphotoalbum; you can record the pictures somewhere, so & Cphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the images 5-9, thumbnails are present, so & Cphotoalbum; you can't view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them again. so, if you want to avoid trouble, such as the mess of your images, please buy a bigger hard disk to store all the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the images menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those you want to make accessible to others and click on the current view lock in the File menu. alternatively, you can also control all the images your little sister may see, and lock the menu item Anything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set which pictures to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop now to your little sister, simply lock the menu entry pictures, so that all the images you have locked can be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, everyone can access the file index.xml, read out or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime. for this reason, & Cphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course, it shows the picture, but additional information you have entered through the image, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the top part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all of these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, appropriate entries to this display. so if you click Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & Cphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus keys. started and stopped the slide show by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer you can simply drag a rectangle into the image. with the Minus button, you can pull out a rectangle with the mouse button. the Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image will not be zoomed. using the same key sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus keys.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you view images it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can view the image abort and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to tag images with characters while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letters. in this picture you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set the features on your images, you can see them in your browser. so if you see all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply tag them all at once. this is described in detail. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do straight away.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to view categories in the preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the picture was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you will allow you & photoalbum; paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not stored with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your mean later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">To turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; select View on the picture from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not completely control, but the documentation to & Povray; you should have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mode views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be shown with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. if you want to render a part of the texture, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse over the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the superordinate object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need another arrangement, you can set it arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the passer to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the flashcards in the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to loosen a view from the anchorage, drag the passer to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the connector bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with view window order... save. it displays a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovray; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon. Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the View scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode is equivalent to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes as you like, from a quick preview to full-screen images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select in the View Render Modi menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the font file size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image clipping into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination mode quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. the default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is continuously divided up and adaptable because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray traverses a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 x 5 (25) will calculate additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays of each pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you turn on Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this tab, you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not met any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; console issue. if & Povray; unexpectedly ends, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import one & Povray; scene, select the menu entry File Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can also insert source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, & kpovray; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. here the path to your document and version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. elevation field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object-catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. here, you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rowed. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor below the objects is rowed. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and swelling value. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. the window instructions section explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination box standard window order: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement using the Add button and delete a select arrangement using the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window order. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New Column, you create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with Karteimap you get a flashcard view in common with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without a closer knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you'll get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultlessly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the User Documentation to & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the knob or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert Endliche bodies Quader) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an awkward method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite layer as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then apply the Apply button or the Entry button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited infinite plane. when you render the scene, the level stretches up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you view the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizon line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens where you can select how to insert the object. please select first subobject. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property tree (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment shows only a matt black material, because you still need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to carry out this step, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you have moved the floor by one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, place a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or hit the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection adjustments are already partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities for you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer will shoot hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through every pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes have been discarded since the last storage.</seg>

<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut keys and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands to & kpovmodeler with this option; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove toolbars for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diffraction individually on the surface without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can show by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return button.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images always want to use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first characters of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1181">& amarok; use like any other programs keyboard shortcuts. below, you can set up a list of these abbreviations and their function. the global keyboard shortcut can set you up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the global keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as & amarok; short commands work. this makes your keyboard to the & amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function could be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options from Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all needed modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialogue --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates file, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, you can exchange scripts with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands. in most cases, the exec () function is used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Specifies the script to display the setup dialog. to save and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is picked up. the script could now query with DCOP functions for more information about the new piece (for example, metadata or unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry was clicked. to remove an entry you can use dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of amarokscript. for this reason, you should correctly name your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can hang it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the wiki scripts page of & amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, instead of having to browse through endless menus. maybe you just search for a certain title from thousands in your collection. mit & amarok; 's Collecting browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which one you want to listen to? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the choice is still difficult, the dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers IFP and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Typically, in the base folder of the Amarok source, you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any trouble while compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& amarok; like most applications, has some options that can be activated or deactivated at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compilation options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. for details, see the system requirements section.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible when the piece is changed, that the playlist window is scrolled / unrolled to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When you change a piece to the context browser, automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & amarok; the Appearance section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & amarok; select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. click Select..., so you can choose a font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1226">Use your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color faces opens the dialog for color selections. if your own colors do not use, the pre-set & kde colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display-Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcard holders, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below, you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The flashcard audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field. some drivers also enable further adjustments to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection. it includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that is to search for music files. to include a folder into the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting up as with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolders recursively: this causes & amarok; both the crossed and their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enable & amarok; to monitor selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Importing playlists: causes & amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination box Driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setting is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup will be used to set up the database for & amarok. on calculator: if the machine is located on which the MySql database is located. after that it is entered under port: the network port under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data needed for the connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The capacity card last.fm sets the support for last.fm. & amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register on the last.fm website.</seg>

<seg id="1241">Interpreting similar performers: after activating this setting, & amarok; a list of similar performers will retrieve the played piece. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to be able to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you must have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assume that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedtelestop.org. Gnome will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to Taglib / share / apps / amarok / share / apps / amarok / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of the libraries used by & amarok were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this will crash when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens during a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-info, but do not label them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarylapp: symbol lookup error: amarylapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok first finds the correct version.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are most easily resolved by an expert using your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help from other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC at irc.freenode.net in the channel # amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for searching for help. please enter only one error, if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok, only a blank playlist will appear. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left-hand side and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the Start subwindow was converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Tools Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the user's rating while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column display review. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different sink (e.g., ossesink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">It does & amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Soundservers with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">At KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed play. read this error report. enlarging the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>

<seg id="1326">The small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for specific pieces. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save it instantly with the help of the playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have the option to import playlists, you are already in the tree view. with a right click on a playlist, you get different ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">In order to play an audio CD, please select an audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. simply drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the Play button.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The audio CD function uses the Audiocd protocol: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The burning function is also available in the playlist. just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu. you have several options for burning a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& amarok; sets the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. besides, some additional packages are listed which make working with & amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM, apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& amarok; is a multi-page multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player also has & amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all the others. the playlists window contains several browsers that allow you to capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display indicating the currently running piece or current stream. just below is the area, the play time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. one click on this area changes the display of the already expired play time to the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the runtime display. you can change through the available analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display, the PL and EQ buttons are also activated. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used for setting up Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the play buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slide controls to set the play position or adjust the volume. with the play buttons you can start / stop the play and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classical to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click on the EQ button in the player window. once you mark the check box equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlists by & amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that it does not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions scare them, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">In the navigation area, you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right, you find the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok, you may notice that the subwindow starts off. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Tools statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to copy the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current play. see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover pictures in the context browser, the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played instantaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the Recommended pieces are the favourites of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums by the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will pop up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, you will try to download the text for the piece from the internet. if no text script is still running, you can choose which is to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping performer - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First of all, the pieces are arranged according to the artist, and there will be another split according to the album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack-albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping performer / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by one another. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces are first displayed by genre, including by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - this attitude works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection box, with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you have different time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year. besides, you can also select your total collection, whereby the filter is practically disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Right-click on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach the playlist to the playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry, you can reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transferring to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn on CD - thus the selected pieces will be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files into the garbage bins... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selection - mark the selected album as compilation, whereupon it appears in various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Upliftment Markup - Change a compilation-marked album back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed under different performers but again under the corresponding artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes handling many playlists easy. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & amarok; to use your iPod with & amarok; for example, it must be included before the start of & amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & amarok; starts, you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer sort in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list performer. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the commit is complete, quit & amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search field with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: by doing so, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter letters, only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separated search terms by whitespace, & amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms OR, search for entries that either contain either one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR 3. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you would like to search for entries that contain spaces, then include the keyword with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield does, but not according to entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example, review: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the keyword: -a little search for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not have the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key and then clicking on the entries with the right mouse button. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left-hand side you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow reverse and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, enlarged analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as what you get in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many other buttons available for toolbars, such as playback controls and volume controls. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and selecting toolbars... select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by clicking with the mouse double in the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry opens the visualisation plugin window. there you can select the visualisations of & amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">This entry provides a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images. you can start it by selecting cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to appear in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & amarok; 1.3. with this function you have more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, the playlist will display a number next to the title. this number represents the order in which & amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the items in the queue management.</seg>

<seg id="1414">Double-click on the playlist, drag them to the playlist window or click on them with the right mouse button and then select Load. thus, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlist Mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can start the play directly. the playlist Recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece by yourself from your collection, so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the latest playlist, activate the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. using the same menu entry, the dynamic mode can also be disabled.</seg>

<seg id="1477">The folder view has an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlocking the disk or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view is also the interface to read and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headstrip is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headstrip does not have any real function, it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog for changing the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. therefore system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work straight away. this dialog is meant to personalize and adjust the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with an & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so your taste and style of your task is crucial to which of the accompanying programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The DCOPRef createMedia DVDProject () DCOPRef createMedia DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void copy.dvd () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can get a project through the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3binterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addUrl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3binterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio creator; is an audio CD; it is easy to read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kAudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on hard drive) and supported by many encoders who encode these WAV files (these Kodierer packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). additional encoders can be added to the program (if they are installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually a per caption) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kAudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codecs must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, only the Kodierer packages must be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to Kodierer, Audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, & kAudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD;. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to bypass a protected audio CD; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup has to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily usage of the user interface is explained afterwards. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface, which you often stumble over at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which codec programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; fetch information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step, for example, there is more information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">If the CDDB inquiry of the CD data starts according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case must first connect to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the set-up catalogue - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it must be noted that before the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog for the type of notification (such as logs, picks) for program events (such as reading & CD; terminating).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, compression ratios and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorten' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important since both encoder produces very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR, common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genobe for music by young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information collected manually or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding systems explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameters of & kAudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the machine. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I'm not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; however, no one can prevent you from being harmed by the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway by a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box to select (send an address). for use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one in the system. in this kind of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if you are using freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia will be used; those who want to know more about it, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. in the first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab to set up the code. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer-package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about Kodierer is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, you can get more information about its switches by entering commands like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio codecs of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You must have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found using a search engine, as it is considered not entirely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have screams on it (eg by trying to copy something in with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & audio creator; something that is supposed to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each output & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them every time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the selection range so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, the effective device name can also be specified. if you can access the drive with other programs, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The KarteiMap General Settings. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is as loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please select, so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The flashcard CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the Internet, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory name is changed with Konqueror &gt; renamed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is about 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load between the hosts is distributed. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but as many firewalls do the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous plays: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, the path / folder can be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything in such a way as it is on the screenshot. the command is a little long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in the event of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of wav files at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we've just finished the basic setup of & cvideocreator; this configuration is used as default for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, is described and set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each output & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; use which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data collected for one & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; input data manually instead of retrieving them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; find this example. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, now the & CD; in the drive that has been defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, look in the section Questions and Answers to the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all the tracks of the pieces are completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic search of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current Title' field, the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Current Title' field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field can be used for individual comments, the commentary box of the album will be used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful withdrawal of the data from the freedb the CD-Editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary volume. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the encoding settings tab; take a look at the 'Basic Settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see Help for the code to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the end-to-end CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the information anyway. for more information go to the freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing OK, go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play. simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the tracks that are selected will be read out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">"" "clicking on the" "" "Select" "" "button has started reading the selection process, so this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens." ""</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we typed here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The assignment 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format. thus, read and code in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. the machine used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of though two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kAudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the codifier of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1615">Strange if you've managed to fetch the source file from the & kde; SVN, then you do not need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke game player by & kde; beside others, it also has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke play of real-time lyrics also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also support the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the song text on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop to drag & drop any MIDI file from one & konqueror; Windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you & kde; ending while playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can choose to open... from the menu File. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from one & konqueror; Windows in the & kmid; Windows drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button to play in the toolbar, select the record from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts once you draw it on the & kmid; (in several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the speed display to change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts the play. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Song lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and again others. some pieces don't have a text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which uses a song so you don't have to set anything manually. so if you select the Automatical text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text is automatically selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries Textereivers or Liedertext from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played after the series. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find them in the Collection item under the item Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. in the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the each one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. consider this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the row from the submenu of the sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs, or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next Song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Previous item, the entry Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano type in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another key map..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as E-Mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you will see how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and don't leave any line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun shooting (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gunshot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term "drum patch" the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is its presence. so, you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywordlists are mostly used to make sounds on the percussions-channel. take a look at the provided Keyboards as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need 16 or 9 channels).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap with the name name is needed for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed only. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that will play a pitch Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two notes up to one octave up. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you will find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of pivatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos, you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played notes. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the Channel view point: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">Tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Disagree, therefore supported & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have an & kde; Desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I play a karaoke file), just change to the & konqueror; change the window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.In. first you only want to play the first file. so, set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.In. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to program on & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.com Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; but I try to take a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and proving phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid, or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a great joy if you send me a postcard from your home town or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact you (if you want to). before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; written completely in my spare time and by no one critiques money for it. I want to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westhoder, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or even a support email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view images. you will find there also links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compiling with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a soundcard, except that you can of course hear no music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made from so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level. when you click on an entry, its group and all its subsets will be copied to the current category and the play starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, one can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, selecting playlists must be selected from the menu, either selecting the Edit Mode, or selecting another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the author's convenience, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / Paint; & lt; / Paint; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here, the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; everything must be configured by typing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, just like setting the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; you can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To allow the & KMPlayer; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog for KDE assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is used in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. the started process is called knpplayer. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always use a given backend for a particular Mime type (of course only if this is determined), this must be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog can be found in the Settings under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb inside.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension must be working for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introspection, pipesource, tvscanner, TVsource, urlsource, vcdsource and vrsource. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints on how to quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be run as root after the device is inserted. it is important to make sure that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does each time my CPU have to be checked for its performance?</seg>

<seg id="1757">Articles (DIN), Buch (DIN), Paper (DIN), Letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is just a brief description of the functions and further information for this is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you want to see greater areas of a green text on the screen, it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, you notice it by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of environments, entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & box; automatically creates a blank line (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu Settings box; Set up LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subsection the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex files, recovery search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI-file was created [i.e., e V ice I ndependence file]], & box; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the actual output art of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file were knocked with the editor and as soon as an element was clicked in the DVI; file, the corresponding section in the & latex. the pre-search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex, source text was clicked, the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used for work with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick release: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is located at any time, and there is no call from & occulation; after quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">The selection boxes have been developed for quick integration of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex. commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Other is for inserting articles such as keywords, notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, an image or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"" "reference: is used for reference to a designated term (choose from a selection box)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¤e is used for defining the font size. it can be set to specify the font size for the main text, the feet notes, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the\\ documentclass command contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] sets the font file. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Building or the press of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source text must be saved before compiling. & Kile; for storing it automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is compiling, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. if it is not the case, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be noted.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few slits should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then be the modification of the fonts within the environment to turn away (engl. Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only secured inside the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italic print and is available until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be displayed italic with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex and markup language is displayed, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & box is now followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do so, a quote, a few passages in fat and intensive print and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl E can be converted back to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some computer drivers. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are needed (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using file printings (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows converting the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex, source code has been created, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-search query allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides an appropriate setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this, only Modern can set up under Settings box... Tools construction should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the pre-selection search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on the search query. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; -viewer is then made.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & occulation; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Ocular; set up as text editor (Settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using the & DVI prompt, there may be an error. if there is a bug, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file lists the source code error source. in the editor, the buttons on LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤chest LaTeX errors can be used between errors. the log file always displays the line in which the error appears. to view the incorrect line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty documents, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document. for more information, see the section below.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & box; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file will be opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can set up in Settings box... Settings Generalities are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering a document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ Documentary class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex files. if an easy way to create a template, you should search for one on the Internet and read the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility to read and emphasize many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">The manual for Kate should be used to find out more about and its possibilities. users of & Kile; can start working directly with the reading of the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be accessed via the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with clickable Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way, clicking on\\ par\\\ bigskip will be\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search for the most different types of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex works differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can include additional diving marks. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the menu entries do not include jumping marks or the corresponding keyboard. this is also highlighted by the jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; Even though & Posters; already excellent opportunities offered in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; essential functions for selecting a & latex; special commands for their selection. under Edit Select, the following commands are included for the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning would include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventable thing in & box; is that the slits are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also heals & latex; commands with a reverse layer (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For listening to a part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the button Delete; offers the key root Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove are the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & Kile; for more commands under Edit Environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environmental commands, you can quickly get lost. this command will conclude the recently opened environment, so that the nested environmental structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups that are defined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located in front of or behind the scaled bracket of a & tex; group #, the group is injected to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested curly groups brackets can be quickly lost. this command completes the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex, two simple instructions are used in & box; for the appropriate implementation it is used in & box; the character is used for two simple instructions. & Kile; knows this case and holds two complete instructions for & latex.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double application mark can set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use foreign-specific settings (e.g. naurus or French) and therefore German or French instructions. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">If the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & box; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, the current line with\\\\ associated with an adjacent line breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings box; Set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to assign columns in tables -environments and all Et-notes (amp;) to each other. & Kile; tries to achieve this. while drumming Shift; Alt; amp; searches & kile; after the next tab in the above line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posts; already offers a good source code completion, it has been added to & Kile; for special commands (usually for & latex;), three different modes are built. all these modes can be configured for different work modes under Settings box...</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} command & box; automatically add the\\ end {environment} command after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and, in most cases, the list is enlarged. on the other hand, the list can also be scaled down by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, a jump to these positions is possible using the Edit pad NÃ ¤chest jumping record and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; Set up... Kile; Modification can be made to these lists. there can be different registry lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ r of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not needed for the execution of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call to complete standby mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, environments are so often used that & box; a special mode for completing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the complete environment or key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button can be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will be closed automatically. once & Kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; Set up... Kile; Modification can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of complete defense modes for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of barriers that can immediately be replaced by more strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile Complete Works. as an example of a cooling list, the file example.cwl is used, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the MenuEdit VerCompleted termination or the key Ctrl + Alt space key, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ r are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many WÃ ¶ rters are written more than once in a document.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up in the menu settings box... Kile can be switched off. here, the threshold value can also be specified for displaying the violation.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but they offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all building tools are grouped in groups in the menu Creating, Creating and Generating View.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer as well as eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used by pressing Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt; 3, by Alt; 4, the DVI; file can be converted into a PS file and used by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Building instruction, a viewer is usually called after the compilation. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the project New Project.... here the following information is asked for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all of these tools use commanders as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as base. the combination yields fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Everyone who worked with the & kde; documentation knows my proc and how superior it is. if we add a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no more dependent on a terminal; just click on the icon for the XML processor and finished!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects an index.docbook folder in the folder. if index.docbook is in the folder, then leave the current working folder. if not, then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder in the other folder.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML files are deleted every time I am started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said, everyone who has already worked on the & kde; documentation already knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the currently opened file is index.docbook, then simply leave the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">When it comes to an output on the screen, your file is defective. please check the reported bug and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked already marks in & quantaplus; then the current file is simply clicked. if not, delete the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the file is well-Formed, click the Well-Formed verification selection.</seg>
<seg id="1925">To use a & DTD; specified in the & XML; file, they choose & DTD; (default), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the & DTD; for both the & W3C; & XML; schema as well as for the RelaxNG verification is the specification of the definition URI; in the file selection is required.</seg>

<seg id="1928">Specify the name of the file as the result should have named. normally, the file is stored in its home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which are & quantaplus; spawn, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone uses the code in & quantaplus; the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start editing plug-ins. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location are used & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often, several people work in a hierarchical relationship with each other in a project. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (her identity) appears bold according to which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides the overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something particular happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project. an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file to the CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">You can either select the comment entry from the Editor context menu or enter the @ annotation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (Role), with the nickname of the top name of the team member, is a role in the project from the following possibilities: team Leader Subproject Leader.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roll names are insensitive to upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the settings menu. here only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the other can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta. this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; concerning tags including car completion can be changed with this. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">"" "large / lower case of tags: large / lower case of automatically inserted tags. normal" "" "Groß / Kleinelling" "" "means the tags are inserted in the same way as they are described in the tagXML files." ""</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal Groß / Kleinelling means the attributes are inserted in the same way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Automatically close optional tags: if attached, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this will be added immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Automatically close not optional tags: as above for all other tags, except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and end day: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic substitution of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of various types of files. restore the standard settings using the Default button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here is stocked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Default DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not detected. however, this setting is stocked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power outage or crash. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or a separate view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI modes and / or appending views. it is equivalent to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source code view in shared mode. regards the different modes, see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the figure of the parser node in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action makes it possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of node is set in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change the structure tree should be automatically opened. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, whereas empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each may be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the clause excludes anything else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plugins can be managed. plugins are KPart applications from third-party, which can be reused by any part-capable application, the best known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located at a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is given to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load the load. only-Lese-KParts generally refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, then test & quantaplus; if the given information is correct. selecting allows saving the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. (3) Debugger was discontinued, as well as support for dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented which allows different implementations of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plug-in is available, the support for use of & guet; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugins in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plug-in drop-in drop-off, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger is made, if necessary, or tells the plugin to listen to debugger requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session Start the session. includes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to request a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. output of this request is shown in the debugger version.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if a debug started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to variable variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a request is given, the execution will begin once a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include it will be properly cleaned.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there is no current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or set to set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can & quantaplus; help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document Type edit packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the Script Languages and / CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic links of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details for conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick inserting of tags into a document without risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag files are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag files carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declare if they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can occur only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but element type about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the type of tag class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to each other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source texts used to fill the attributes in the tag Editordialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cut and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tag name%, meaning the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that summarizes the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end one day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a fracture, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog above is in & quantaplus; start window and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is performed only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt;; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as fairly simple and there is an editor for it attainable via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited by diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Verturn 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... to create. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button symbol assigned to this action. by clicking on the user button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the Detailierten settings and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but on it it is not limited), which can change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / share / apps / Quanta / scripts local script folder: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above-listed methods, a script can input from & quantaplus, to the default input. in the selector input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output. it can be specified what is to happen with the text written to the default output by setting the value the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in a given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the checkup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you are planning to use them, enable" "" "Edit day" "" "dialog if available, so that an input is possible when using the action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & Kmenu;, graphics More programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose editing size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually labeled as loose, starting, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signals that clicking this icon is a & lt; startgt; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the icon, it has to be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the action you want. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, as there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared this to a better overview by some separator into several groups. open the toolbar and adjust dialog about settings tool bars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to add to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the correct folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2html tag2 = tag2.html...</seg>
<seg id="2061">The Tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit to the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder appears!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to form context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply by $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (just as you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this is good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not get rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">Resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. in different places there is an email send with email, send tool bar toolbars with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus, users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a final contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource pass the input fields (URL Preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), high load tool bar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, inquire & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. please read the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format might be necessary. there is a simpler way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions: the string that appears in! doctype tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and to draw full use of quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked as global, is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoglizes the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editor window, the tree view, the dividers with info and the toolbars. please hit in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jumping to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangles in the Editor area lead to another context menu related to the edited document content, such as editing / copying / pasting, editing the tag under the mouse-cursor, using the word under the mouse-cursor or opening the file if the string under the mouse pointer calls a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional serves as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; PGT; in your document, then click the icon representing the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building manners (QIT) enable to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate them, open them and roam. in the representation with dividers are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool which & quantaplus; provides. this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, upload or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information into a script. by clicking with the right mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, mania can change attributes and namespaces. the entry system based on the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two carts at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and you will receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an EMail, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is in the PATH in front of their bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for that the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why developers, what already someone else developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detail documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or help khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Convert special characters to & HTML for inserting from the clipboard there, so they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script will issue error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removal and switching of the problem-porter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the icon column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Creates a dialog to add a new toolbar. it only creates the name. actions must be saved using Settings actions... Edit toolbars are stored by toolbar toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows you to upload toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access them. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; who has made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be freshened without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one. this record is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting tool bar is denied when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu points above. click on it. clicking on an activated plug-in activates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on the tag; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window to / off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & posters; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbars, or which you can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help corresponding to the mouse-pointer's surroundings, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, as the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project, e.g. after completing the project name. all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted using Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering Name, file will be filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except for local data. either a name (hostname.exe) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote host's settings, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. several files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be attached when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started from scratch, not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder, and you can make a detailed selection of good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the Project Properties menu in the subwindow profiles or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings are similar to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcard holders possible) that are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in this case the debugging is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">High loading profiles (see in) can be set in the subwindow profiles as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by indicating its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can switch event actions and add, change or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. it is not possible to influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the Menu Project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders will behave as well, but the opening and opening records are missing... in the context menu callable with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button is blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by the user. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-profile profiles can be created and therefore the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can't be read easily, but anyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be a lot of views in one project, i.e. by simply dipping the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted in the Project toolbar's menu or the project tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps boost productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; best stackable above the toolbar menu. use and add are different. adding toolbars is treated at the bottom of the Add tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be adjusted either using context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions like toolbars can be removed, toolbars can be rename, or toolbars can be executed, where you can specify which actions to be visible on these or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings... and set Settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; use templates basically like a common filesystem with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or merge any existing directory into the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are available in template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. a simple framework for the purpose and organises work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found in template tree among global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates for whole websites serve as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save As local template save....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save choice as local / project template. alternatively, you can simply drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as pulling and dropping or inserting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file, select a name for the template and back up. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can submit headlines and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert or link files. additionally, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / share / apps / Quanta / share / apps / Quanta / utilities.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and applies to everything except the root folders in the template table. if a root folder would be set in such a way, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building block. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a previous or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and by copying content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally you have a context menu (to indicate right mouse button) about a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source editor available through the View menu. the first mode substitutes the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL editor functions as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back when required to the source editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document containing & PHP; a small green symbol shows the VPL's default. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL editor. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that the changes in the source text editor and the VPL editor are visible and the cursor is running synchronously in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor. pressing F9 is already active, the push of the button moves the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization gap between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is configurable via Settings Quanta. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small span for fast hosts and a large range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, tools can be selected. thus, editing invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor is also called when a new document with the VPL editor is created. this is used to reduce the decoding of the VPL editor. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click in the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS stylesheet by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Use of cursor is possible as in a word processor, due to moving with arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves peculiarly. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the button or removed button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way over the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, needs to be removed each other Anchor Tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the spreadsheet assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists have to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets. in contrast to other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style sheet can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kwar3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & khei3; could show differences within a line and changes to white signs. later, a lot more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kwar3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & kwar3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and mimic the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed prominently. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble when someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ from files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all the files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make typing work easier by fully writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Foldable folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open Dialogue enables manual typing of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders is introduced. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kwar3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When combined, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting to merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in Open Dialogue you don't have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large amount of effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, drag them into & past3; load them and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste, and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can do nothing out & scratch; pull out. only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the character A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in rare, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file doesn't have lines. if the line breaks enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison window) also has an info line with the write output:, the filename and [changes] when you edit the result. usually it contains text by automatic merge, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the Springe buttons to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference must also be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also include a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, no more line is left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps yet again choose another source. this text will not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; conflicts of merge; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignoring the options numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate primarily with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click on one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, high, bottom, side, side, beginning, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other keys to edit. by using the add button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl image) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict. note that & kdiff3; all non-resolved conflicts are still considered a conflict even after manual resolution.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the clipboard to the clipboard, you must copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if enabled, you will automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. be careful with this option, as you may accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line-end of the source files, so you should not use & past3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of most recently used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; Set Default...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width for selection, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic script will be displayed. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be shown astert. on these systems, the button presets automatically create an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, any selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. you will then no longer need to copy the manual to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kwar3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored. even when merging white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart track sign '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, but then files with different sizes in page-to-side comparison look identical, though they are different. if this option is checked, this option may be disabled. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely searching for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In auto-skip mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will appear before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, use better the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and merging a merge. see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backing.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapt the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must & scratch; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding appears a short note, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted. because coding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which code to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this down to suppress changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore digits or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color coded transition column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & khei3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly suits your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessor command. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. each input line has to have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program that by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line spacing to convert the input into upper case letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a true expression of the characters found in a row. the\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in uppercase. the\\ U converts the found text in capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). now, a pre-processing command for line reconciliation requires $\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line deviations. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to do several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the composition. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Generating / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs only a few details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for viewing and merging. subsequent operations only change the data that the line-like algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that hides text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify the folders on the command line or in the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as the base. if no destination folder has been specified, the folder will be used as a destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will inform a small news window about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folder is complete, & kwar3 shows; a list window with the results on the left hand side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or double-click on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories open and all subdirectories open up to which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison starts and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the plug-in action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is identical even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. with folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying of B (or if B does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified, and if the option synchronizes directories active. then select & kdisper3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & past3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe), then examine & kwar3; the date of the files and suggest the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file will be executed after the other. it status column displays skill when merging was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected as full analysis in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds) or all entries at once. if you have selected all plug-in actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder-merge mode C is used as a target, with the two-folder merge, B is selected as the target and when syncing A and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all the entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options skipped through the particular entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / resume in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options Browse, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you first want to see what would happen without the real changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kwar3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merging window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select the start / resume directory merge, or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kwar3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to determine the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually compiled, these entries (in the current session) will not merge again. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings menu - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this can be set up folder specific with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems, a predefined point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the Elementtree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links display. this is downlighted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kwar3; a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to a continuous loop and & kwar3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">(the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders to a slow network, it might be faster to compare the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. the results of merging files are also stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is the knowledge provided that the other file was not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and preserves the extension .orig. When an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not just merging entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible while merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to, you can turn the option folder & text window into the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-click. nevertheless, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly, without first having to run the folder merge. to do this, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again when you start folder merging.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: reinvading</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty strings &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link is pointing to a file or a folder. then a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviates from the original. (note the option Confidential of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference beholder in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first starts the built-in difference beholder. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference beholder and then select in KDEVELOP from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & past3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, & kwar3; specify that the input file is a patch file in the unified format. then starts & kwar3; then starts & kwar3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kwar3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now available) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by stressing in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or that they will go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kwar3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is the rest of this, is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required for this was too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE, please visit the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the last changes under http: / / kslo3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir indicates the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kwar3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems while compiling. if you still encounter difficulties, please report to the & kde; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift pasting) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update button after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied when merging. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a thumbnail of all virtual working surfaces. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the workspace, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both within a desktop and at multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual workspace as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background by & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries Pager set up... and ending. if however, click on an application inside & Kpager; click on the icon and the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and exit.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicking on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicking on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, in & Kpager, the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; view the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled along with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise only empty workspaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the layout of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, all virtual working surfaces appear in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with their contents and move. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and choose to set up switches... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign it to it. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer harnesses a while at the same point. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click emulate pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to make it clear again: even if the cousetool; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for each.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can execute pulling with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click brings out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Move is enabled, the turnaround time (1 / 10 s) is enabled. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse is done.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strobo.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a sliberegler sound buffer, which you adjust to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later use the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to decrease with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of where a mouse click is without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not make a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse-mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you view the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks out the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. however, park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. this way, an accidental moving of the mouse can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent drive, but I don't make it possible to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to select text to copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move when you just start & kmousetool; use this instead: run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible click of the mouse. the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the move time starts with intelligent delay. later, you can use the smart move even without the audible click of the mouse. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and they are set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters text is processed before it is sent to the program speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is presented to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text on a website can be read, you can chat with & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you send from the Karteimap orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of Screen-Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader while & ktts; just one reads, this output is stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen-Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with pre-defined set-chain filters that allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for converting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a more intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; contained in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; if you have set a female voice for example on the KarteiMap Spokesperson, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters set up. if a filter is not enabled, it is not activated and will not be used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the further below are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern to set up character sets. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged against the associated subtext.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it must be distinguished only by the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Erbet column.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2679">To compile & ktts; you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for kdevils or downloaded the tarball that is currently available each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use it, first check if the speech synthesizer works correctly with your speech synthesizer. for this you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>

<seg id="2688">With these sliders you set volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select a few knobs and this grey is displayed, the voice that you choose will not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with greater memory usage) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click on Apply). see.</seg>

<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that pronounces messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can chat with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, add & ktts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voice, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of abbreviations. SSL is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSL only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) because this is the default voice used in the edition of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100lt;%, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sentences. this can be faster with reading, since only the first set can be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">At the first start of & ktts, a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add other set of rules recognition filters, beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speech selection by selecting it. switch on the choice of speakers, which speaker & ktats; select. turn on the speaker selection, change some features, and check how the choice of the speaker is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel orders on the Karteimap, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the standard limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limiters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabulator characters are removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limit filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knot), warnings, messages, or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the standard limit recognition filter from default, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>

<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also place multiple marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the distribution of the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio, there is a setting speed. to make this work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizer modules like Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; pre-read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSL.)

<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, open speech synthesizer written in & Java; i.e. you need to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. mit & Java; can neither adjust pitch, volume nor speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; with any speech synthesizer, which can be controlled in a command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device.</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and usage of & knetworks.conf, a module for the & knetworkconf, which enables management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed at & kcontrolcenter; the Network Setting module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and allows the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing & installing Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the selection will be offered. it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release date. selecting non-re-enquiries can be made permanent. the next start of the network settings will then be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are gray, which means the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Rider Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the Rider Network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings shown on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are executed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manually can be made without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. switching on an off-off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as a standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution calculator allows a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be added to top priority by selecting an entry and / or downgrading in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By pressing the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. then the entry is inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click on the Edit button....</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list Namely familiar computer describes machine name-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily at booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list includes some familiar computers some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple Alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name-known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit your calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Setting module are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, you have to set the following command in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The home page of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the precompiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used like kpackage or the installation tool for your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not only, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second part all of & knetworkconf, changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are run with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found great dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact point, which hastens a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own host). the default route is required for the IP relay.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections so it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections there is another content than fixed there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected may therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which additionally offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be included by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; split the band back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & kdat; the pre-tensioning on the tape does not, you'll be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the default, searches for the matching index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you'll be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been inserted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding out the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejection of the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting by & kdat;. if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be formatted before use, it must be formatted. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the belt name and capacity, proceed with the format of the tape. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically included and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files listed in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save File menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens up settings for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">The dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or the folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on any of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, you need to mark the files that are to be recovered. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for restoration. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for the restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restoration settings, the dialog appears again. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can regenerate the index to two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a security profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders which are listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems can be listed separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Executing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & quot; & quot;; & lt; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, send & kdat; before the tape is integrated the command will load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the release of & kdat is automatically ejected; automatically discard the tape. do not use this option with floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; the hardware-rich block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a volume formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this sequence is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the complete name of the system on which the volume has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the volume was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar -archives, which can be handled directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystem log; experienced users quick access, for example, to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystem log; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and analyze the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In current version 0.4.1 has & kedlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log. if you don't see it, and it opens, instead of its a small message window, you have & ksystemlog; most likely you don't have permission to read the protocol under Linux in the / var / log file, for which normal user usually does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter out a selected criterion or string. the list of the log-lines will now be changed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed to match the selected filter. in the default setting, the selection field contains the entry All. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then only matched with entries in the corresponding column. for example, select the column process in the protocol file system log, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than protocol lines of the level Note. the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display a specific process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can use the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystems.forum-software.org. This site provides you with more up-to-date information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and named so) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init quickly becomes the standard for checking the program start when running the system in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not below / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without a reinstallation and reformat. so you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc rather than directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to start when the system starts up or when you switch to another runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such stuff as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port when you start up.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at various points after the program and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does all the right scripts start? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no proper files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually run these scripts from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when it contains a K, the script is called up with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; I could also have a user runlevel, the & quot; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runlevels or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if you extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you move them to a new range. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already been in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to activate the different working areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection ober- or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another running level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runlevels, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; running at Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (like eg, Apache and httpd) simply exit without a message when their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears to the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some maps are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space limitations (quota) for users, a card card is created by which you can make individual adjustments. other flashcards will appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card will appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one integrated file system footprint (Quota) is enabled and initialized (identifiable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space restrictions are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the field file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tab group informs about the group members of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or Deleting the selected user or the selected group functions similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change boot password, change time to boot of the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
