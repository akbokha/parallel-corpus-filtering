although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and practiced his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very swe@@ dish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ots person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , the Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung agreed not with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
it is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values they incar@@ n@@ ate deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump was clearing his way to nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the presi@@ dency of a man , gave to a man - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters to be ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people said one of my friends is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
but you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to lift a man who looks at those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whi@@ pl@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the big van Jones described has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose , as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of America &apos;s white American promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say .
at all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices got lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; NO ! &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ lat@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what does the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community have in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for their abuse of drugs and gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day after day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n &apos;s largest garbage dump in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ lat@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and a music teacher of the children of C@@ lat@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same point where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio showed something he had never seen before : a violin made out of rub@@ b@@ ish .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and live with him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ lat@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork are successfully comb@@ ating illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
in West Africa , it was known then that this ship had already been involved in illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before the other coast of Africa was searching for .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on its shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia because of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who then drove the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate contemp@@ t of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing had once been ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail speed , with which information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely follow the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . such susp@@ icious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly , if they have a criminal code .
countries that are illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue that the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lost each year due to the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from around the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , imag@@ inary names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a land could say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are not allowed to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that have distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found refuge and found refuge .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing over great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

the Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , meaning that they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
in collaboration with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organization , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system permits the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals , but also deter@@ ring them .
ships that had previously been exploited without a license and had hardly reck@@ oned with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now posted a 33 % increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats have purchased more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tra@@ w@@ l nets on board which were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces to form the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With certainty , the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures develop in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia claimed his first great triumph : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also in@@ filtr@@ ated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the topic of environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; reg@@ ain@@ ing the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s presi@@ dency .

after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the opposition &apos;s motion for a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into void by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central North of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the reluct@@ ance to re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rate are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance , Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica , or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on 27 October .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil stri@@ pe and on 3rd November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .

on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves sm@@ ote the news of police repression in the centrally located north @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round , which ren@@ ders the scale of repression a day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a ministry of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ys Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado state that 1 % of signatures are counter@@ fei@@ ted .
here is your ministry !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and has tended to let the critical voices become silent :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches increasingly increase frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fies to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
the trial ended on 24 August 2016 for crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secret .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was the Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison until 1978 .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ Ã±@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testi@@ fied to a federal court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the gym@@ nasi@@ um . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they don &apos;t kid@@ nap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gym@@ nasi@@ um . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told me I would be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secret agent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the other , the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
during the first and the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get off . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were turned off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I sp@@ un in and saw a couch that people were tortured .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there .
they rarely caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and drove it a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there in it was app@@ alling ... like a dirty no@@ ble@@ man .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that someone else can do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ i know that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eyel@@ ashes .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face down - all were tied up on hands and feet .
near the entrance , people chew@@ ed quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and were put to death by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were several rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , the Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ ad Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , killed the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apping came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be laid .
this was the lie - euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military symbols , which one takes on an enemy that one has fought .

but when one goes into a house and the refrigerator , record player , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal the cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can give me a load of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to cancel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now that I am older , I feel regret .
I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops on and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom they could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grinding and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something stays always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can repro@@ ach me that I have been pre@@ occupied . I have finally declared against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 Com@@ miss@@ ars were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ it@@ ances .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian staff .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for justice for the victims for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research for it lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

translation errors causes older people in Kyoto to &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot;
the shield with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license , last month witnessed a very mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly - but also with malicious h@@ ind thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levi , widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which has been published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , even if gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture are sorry for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported how follows the exc@@ uses :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) from our side , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News talked about the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , who are involved nationwide in accidents , is quite an occasion for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 cases of sen@@ iors were caused by a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors suffered 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the named re@@ porter published comments on the light showing the prejudi@@ ces that some Japanese seem to face against older drivers :
the article on the translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How wrong is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills , in order to understand the source text and active language skills , in order to transfer him to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers in the target language .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , searching for costs or the relatively low number of English speakers learning Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , nevertheless make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered the best , are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the pro@@ ver@@ ted and enig@@ matic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate tee @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
the main site of the &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later on , other users wrote that the internet websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online trans@@ mit@@ ters also recorded photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was m@@ apped , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ ith : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are closed again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net website .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ GA@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ cast@@ ers . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly tran@@ sm@@ its its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if a web site is blocked by DNS , the server will respond in error or deny the request when entering such a website .
we will confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ ong@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was dis@@ continued on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV com@@ rade El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects witness testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a correction report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their minor son or her minor daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ mp@@ ed to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family whose daughter is in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with her and justi@@ fies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never find out about it .
in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , received a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent be@@ atings . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra arrived on a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows than children are registered , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined .
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a spe@@ edy investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n may be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is in court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
in doing so she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , puri@@ fied the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over she went home and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I could get more books from the house &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
the Administr@@ ative Director is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
starting on Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the publisher of the display switched on once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .

bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media must be registered in Egypt by a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established , which is intended to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site with their correct names and identity ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose their registration . unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , member of Parliament and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Ministry to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison term was envis@@ aged for those who are found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; making protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian leop@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ d sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . all in all , it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals , the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and growth of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately showing a different side of her country , which is not only composed of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to creating protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom disaster in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s north @-@ east , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to be ev@@ acu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had destroyed entire coastal cities from the map .
for this reason , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had an atomic accident , already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement homes ( in the ) Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms 70 percent of the final light .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of shel@@ ters from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ shel@@ ters ( in the Cau@@ ca@@ sia , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still to be reloc@@ ated .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the people ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were still living in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated refugees who were resi@@ ding after the disaster in accommodation were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
according to the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by disaster have re@@ opened its doors by December 2016 , accounting for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident took part in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land in large areas .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are lying in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but here again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants make it difficult to earn a living .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated people . she questioned her about the status of the reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy towards the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk has changed .
in their introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that there is still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
nearly 63@@ ,000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in permanent replacement homes .
according to the 2017 budget , some 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are still living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated people are older than 50 years old . they are known to be more known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive building projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .

when people come across people from other countries who speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , one often notices that it connects one more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Cri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini explains how a hike made her affection to Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was sent to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had hit him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a head@@ stock against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a head@@ stock . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the completion of the investigation into the incident by the active service .
the pictures show the police officer as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive station , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ eur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs soon rush to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also pl@@ ung@@ ed into social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus at the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; against police violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the drawing has been divided into social networks several times .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . release with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father because he sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools .
police interro@@ gations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were deployed in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to for@@ go violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again Brazilian media have sli@@ pped street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically talked about a broken glass window in order to depic@@ t their Tit@@ anic pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
you must also recognise this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the ab@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso Act , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular village of Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as the Central - on Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
after getting ready , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period of time are in operation since they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members precisely that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane manufacturers were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ arable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 centres per pound , according to the 2016 edition of &quot; Agricultural Eff@@ ects &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said that the factory was shut down , not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
these were officially written documents , which were only distinguished from the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , whose construction it helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work sheet set has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the employment and services generated by the plants in the congreg@@ ations where they were located .
we will never know if during Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the popular community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to dis@@ courage them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms too .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without future prospects , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continue to be impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to retirement at age 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is bit@@ terly .

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop increases that the young participants in talks like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever happens to them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the strain of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to keep my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
in this way , they can grow and also go ahead of our youth
this is how they can do what they have determined by the Creator .
in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and inserts the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and is now reis@@ su@@ ed with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( at the same time ) outside of a typical Japanese restaurant .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes at almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ gu@@ u ( in the evening , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the canton of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend revers@@ es them today in conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ gu@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone strips decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were converted to mosquito nets , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an emperor @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we made for the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone boo@@ ths and mobile phone designers will allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone @-@ stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
further quir@@ ky plastic courts can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # ( ) , in the # , in a well @-@ known version .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which de@@ votes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missed and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a car@@ tel , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ illing a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning with drug trafficking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the battle between law enforcement agencies and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and therefore entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear changes life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father , who searches secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews in just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we are again preparing ourselves today for the task that we have placed before and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ rene a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fragi@@ lity and the state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it takes me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is opposed or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
the seri@@ ousness of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; so@@ aking . &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not stir and remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was sack@@ ed with threats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never dies , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because they don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive or kill you .
in these horrible days I asked myself if wines would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us he needed to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life is made of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Council for Public Security and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ illing a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades in an understandable way .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this post and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fak@@ ten@@ check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a for@@ gery .
but how is the year after something has emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of accurate reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to it .
authorities described a fire@@ ball containing dozens of houses including a cinema close to people who were full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ably .
a picture entitled &quot; That &apos;s Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of that day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story doesn &apos;t end .
over the years , the same photo has been taken over several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses drastically reported atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count dead bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a man of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted graphi@@ cally .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
indeed , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting orders for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments like this example fal@@ sely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash report , published by the United Nations describes those who could escape strikes , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ sts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that fal@@ sely claimed that Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being a mon@@ k and politi@@ cian involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ an being to this statement , but had not brought the picture from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have established examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also linked to one another in some cases ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases which can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the card in Orange ) :
map : news frames .
examples of false copies of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers where the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or false messages are still available .
the gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to deli@@ gi@@ timi@@ ze , since the photos were used ab@@ used .

this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news website wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar was admitted by Th@@ an in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Roman Catholic news site An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te the fact that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massac@@ res of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums like this are in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
the Embassy in which the picture was included in the DR Congo dist@@ anced themselves from the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have pic@@ torial data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the image will eventually bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence associated with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot believe these images any longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images have des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and emp@@ ower them to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture is suggest@@ ing something , which can actually be used in terms of context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally they can be .

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
there are words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Van@@ u@@ atu language version , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Imag@@ ine your parents in recognition of how they care for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
words in the H@@ uns@@ ellor language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after getting angry in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other forms of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite files here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ames the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the Sri Lanka disaster centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people were missing because of the floods and mud wave winds .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people have been brought to 304 locations .
the ra@@ inf@@ all left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods destroy the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are completed to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also decided to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ i@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks anxious people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ op@@ ic Center will be informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides .
the joint efforts of the Government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of safety and provide relief measures .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
used in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend .
I trust in her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the i@@ con@@ ian image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others can@@ st slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they ex@@ ert me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow all of us are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , will be removed .
to be Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is mostly sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a major part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid put the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to understand them .
I &apos;ve been working in the mess@@ aging industry for thir@@ teen years and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , incorrect nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have w@@ aged in the last three decades , while the United States won &apos;t even vote their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ ber@@ n@@ ated with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are aimed at anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ stem@@ med Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American separ@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irre@@ fut@@ able Muslims and Americans .
but am I now irre@@ fut@@ able Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or wearing my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ cap , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight far @-@ spread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ eit information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger , who tear the sc@@ arf out of a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below .

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surge that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I swa@@ yed her in my arms and whis@@ pered her the Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author , when she wins an icon contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters finally pos@@ ing in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as she has decades ago won a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be a Muslim means to speak the prayers she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - has been col@@ oni@@ alized by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging is to grow up and hear that men don &apos;t we@@ ep , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an irre@@ versi@@ bly wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be a Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first bom@@ b@@ astic bom@@ b@@ ings of history a century ago was thrown over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time Grand@@ father &apos;s grandfather , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was designated as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ mind@@ ful history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , called Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
Mal@@ col@@ m X means calling an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life counts .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple lashes but fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ strar that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that sh@@ uts down its borders to people from just the countries that are bombing it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we carry and the bombs that we throw down to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 on evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression that we understand in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten stories .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ bath Muslim ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why con@@ spir@@ ators , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they are domin@@ ating large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim .
things I have left in my speech here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to someone else .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not the terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us , or that we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Facebook page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being fought and human beings have been en@@ cir@@ cled by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , was even a scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions , according to the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I have been doing in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban diversity
story@@ telling , by fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the diversity of languages from major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to , feeling , feeling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers write their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the audience listening to them .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the story @-@ nar@@ rator R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the f@@ able from har@@ es and the bab@@ oon in the Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to extend it . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico demands re @-@ fixing of sovereign debt from the USA
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 ; the march started with the pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ous Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went off to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ates for the re @-@ establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which operates in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not settle down with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state alliance integrated territorial waters of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
for this reason , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation , focuses on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens , to be rejected by the people .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for more than a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ el campaign was dedicated .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of es@@ says dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the Intro@@ duction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked alongside this page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information whatsoever about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what did we give up in this process of sometimes extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police had taken Bass@@ el as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , they were contacted by persons who presented themselves to be the insi@@ der of the Assad government and notified them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the surrounding public in Syria .
Barry Earth , a designer , technologi@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project created by Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture mixes with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught fellow prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting , a bill that she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that every danger doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crush of prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get back all the moments ,
and cry over your absence and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
while in the process
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ hir &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our demand today in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release of detention again on previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants for disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( some 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds of the Mozambique airports , whose Council presi@@ ded over Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for its resum@@ ption to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action good .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward in regard to the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we have to note is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the re@@ pul@@ sion .
the company seemed to be silent , however , and did not indu@@ ce appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be an advis@@ er after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been shut down .
he could keep paid presentations and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to pay for his silence .
re@@ fut@@ ed !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director has no moral whatsoever :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks moral means to return and to serve the state * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself solely by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand it turned out to be an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el prison not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he firmly confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ or@@ ah said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years old and was released .
and today the company , in which he dis@@ likes mon@@ ies , is under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Standardi@@ zation ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 . may 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split@@ ting b@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in bur@@ mes@@ an Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely con@@ notation con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about their use have been cens@@ ored .
furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basically different mean@@ ings , which have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ f@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; like this :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a word play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that she will l@@ essen hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before del@@ eting all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words opposite .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( split@@ ting axes ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who propag@@ ate hate speech , receive a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propag@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to clean , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not meet Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and thus banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech , but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the congreg@@ ations in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to take control of hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law forbi@@ dding this practice so that the age @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Chil@@ d@@ hood Convention , the min@@ ors as defined , every person under 18 years . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements striving to aboli@@ sh laws for children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . without a doubt , they helped to bring about this outcome .
however , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for instance , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the childhood that they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained it - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country has to agree and let the law proclaim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators announced a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one opposed it .
once approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws were finally changed .
member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , a member of the Ministry of Education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk which has disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law noted :
the marriage @-@ ready age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on am@@ ending the law was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties voted against have voted for the law .
the marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer permitted .
it was a long battle ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to deliver on his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite lawful when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished for the debate on the subject in a different way .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that we are inviting the state into our bedroom , we would simply talk about it that the state , our daughters , protects that it may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws which prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring web pages Turkish users can view Wikipedia content
the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , obsc@@ ured internationally .

for over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking .
although many tech @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to using circum@@ vention tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now available .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of the legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to copy sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents on a decentr@@ alised and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
a su@@ h@@ len@@ ding rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours .
that motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation assi@@ sts him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a leop@@ ard would be .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist village of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leop@@ ard was in and I immediately began to cra@@ ckle the pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood face to face with Tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book was released . he immediately sat down , we look at him and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
his passion for the advancement of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife , however , is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to shoot in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist shel@@ ters .
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid speaking the names of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , get this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a mock court and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives is also common among men . however , they do not have to fear much less re@@ mitt@@ ances if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel as well as house@@ wives , played a unique club , thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs available in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her panel discussion was women who do not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
not speaking out loud the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom which they all du@@ ly uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought about their hus@@ bands &quot; name , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from Wal@@ he village in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , she just chu@@ cked in front of herself ; another decided to let the whole infected fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands at their names .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put to the women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation created violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , showing the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would bear the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he did it also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and I listened to carrying him .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the disc@@ us club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ a @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a pair of trousers , they did not dare .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion lap so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will make it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly into the rolls :
so far , we have made only small steps .
some women tried it a few times but then stopped saying the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only when they are alone and not other members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the disc@@ us club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I &apos;m it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia police warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .
photo : other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of single persons for organ trafficking , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , dis@@ qui@@ ets the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they had been used to make use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a single man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC explained .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ ination for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN in 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique for bald men in Mozambique are the goal of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ an police according to the latest assass@@ ination of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ hai Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of single @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ deca@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has given cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head had power , generating wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been killed in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ MAN E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country in which the people would be ashamed to demand sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to achieve rapid wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humour could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ted that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ amor@@ ous :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ ambi@@ an authorities are very concerned about the murdered people &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively engaged in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in the Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ hir wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were themselves the insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death but gave no further information .
Bas@@ hir &apos;s stay and constitution was unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future we show the honor of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of Open Web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , the organisation of the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death in custody , the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us Case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokesman said that he deemed it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to release appeals from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or to give him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some of the reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations had to put pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about the release of Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a shock after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for a unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States ( USA )
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman in the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June the news agency AF@@ P that the embassy requests the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy &apos;s invitation drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the foreign ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley stated that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which it claims according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a ruling in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can enter a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s Reu@@ ters news agency reported that China had great concerns whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada , Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be taken care of by his family .
Li@@ u attorney previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of expression .
France , France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry asked China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the governing Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader of Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged as I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised on an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , as compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one hears that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore could not be measured with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of that , it seemed inevitably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ red corresponding questions in a rational way with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I think it is a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
when An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review breaks the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cre@@ dul@@ ously committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokesman ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are seen only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister need to pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink human identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to affir@@ m , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you an American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication mostly follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may be war@@ y of rage when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little difference between us and Canadi@@ ans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag clearly visible to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ...
so it was already when I began travelling around the world twenty years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their bags to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons here !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ inn@@ y - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has their own Canadian double @-@ go@@ ers ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a principal property of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool poli@@ ten@@ ess .
Canadi@@ ans often don &apos;t talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a Pop band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Ink describes a young man telling what rules his girlfriend does to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
have a look at these recordings of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has per@@ sist in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army an absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; rule 11 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change in settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online contents and prosec@@ uted persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict end to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( insul@@ t of maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems pursued by the Jun@@ ta is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the band &apos;s te@@ aser showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly re@@ covers in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Central Asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ s@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after it has barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and they are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty people live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ eks , which still host one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover my hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply prohibited us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden nor house , it &apos;s very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other villa@@ gers are trying to meet regularly and to celebrate public holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s talk partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite their relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , it lost its anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a ruined building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now follows the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ convenience in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2,@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside .
she does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , buy them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ch@@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children back there .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil previously and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup of So@@ ccer .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he said , smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her that their guests often send text messages when they have continued to greet them or to report on their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken refuge in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered .
at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travelers seek quiet tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy about her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ ma , she leaves a lot of photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , as she pre@@ tends to me .
Ya Spanish Fu@@ er@@ on , repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you &apos;ve gone . &quot;

the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of Ur@@ um@@ qi got a cell phone alert in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , authorities must also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after installing the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications on digital cens@@ orship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often submit extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published by cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors checked the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ App .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
furthermore , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive , has also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ise the spread of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
an up @-@ to @-@ date report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
on 27 June , the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang issued a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where all important things have disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside .
one that ren@@ ders all glory to their name .
one that has reflected in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out for death .
all doubts arise in smoke , and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth moves on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied ourselves to a glorious picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled all my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can return your voice after you have scre@@ amed you all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot;
his eyes filled with hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re really sad to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office leading through a corridor to the individual cells .
I have all the details in detail before I enter the room .
otherwise , this time they have allocated me a larger cell .
I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ crat left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a well @-@ known middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we &apos;re all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
be a li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to exp@@ el all these crow@@ s that lab@@ elled at the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams are ring@@ ing , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of corruption until I saw the yellow light that the Gre@@ ys presented to us : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th Sh@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
in order to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close field of view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he catches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are young , you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to get used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to accu@@ stom myself or badly to be punished , although I had done nothing to earn this penalty .
in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cries .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not find any favour at all , which is why he resor@@ ted to an electrically charged rod .
electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to store my whole quarter .
my half @-@ naked body stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fearful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sl@@ ings to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the upper@@ most floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ witnesses ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee from the second generation . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured in water dissolved Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot Jun@@ it@@ day has little to do with protest against Islam .
generally speaking , the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the che@@ eks of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison .
the Ministry of Interior has recently canc@@ eled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b told CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled due to the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la regarded the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement would probably not be simply sil@@ ken rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly obvious emerging reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b fell victim to traditional sexual organs by abor@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently set @-@ down unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years , the number of &quot; hon@@ ours of honour &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be held in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee from the family are often necessary for the woman to take nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been regarded as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was fed into politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are at the core politically can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated conspic@@ u@@ ously often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still strongly cens@@ ored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember later that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and his opinions were cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but it was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ anda , a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory , thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ anda , who later was to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can we not ?
the real problem , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the educational network , argu@@ ing that comment@@ aries in social media are critical of the problems associated with deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordan .
Jordan has resist@@ ed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s what H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will aw@@ aken to genuine and fundamental frank@@ ness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and on artificial nature . at least he hopes .
as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ at Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we had a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two solid cars are just to be seen .
yet for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ula festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

external appearance and body care have rarely been as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth off crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of the region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts face each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks of them , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of receiving bad advice a training in hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district on which we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel alien@@ ated to accommodate affection ?
this is exactly what the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga donated by the foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ as p@@ or la @-@ li@@ aciÃ³n campaign ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
in front of the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried out their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , which needed most urgent consideration .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
to date , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves to the way they had done earlier to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter carried me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life somebody wrote something like that , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was too tired of war , sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
as a pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice helped the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more precisely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following a letter :
the Colom@@ bians were made aware that after dis@@ armament , peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , to rise up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors activists have witnessed the reports of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports published to address the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her to go to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life , she went to the USA in the last analysis .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen Friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents took the lap through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the rear seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you care ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming .
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : what ail@@ ments were you laid in - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there &apos;s my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that it was all a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets at the top , others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put my SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to figure out how to look at the person they remember from their past - so on my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who has been locked in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not complete a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Cad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but purpos@@ efully sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was in the process when these people were taken along .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports to this date . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , before 2003 I was already known all over the world , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to approach the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally pushed us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria Law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Defense of Sh@@ aria never even j@@ ammed my hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes in front of you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the Plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you at once with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic is constantly worsen@@ ing .
OC Media : what action are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I have no c@@ ents for that .
I discovered these people myself when I oc@@ cured sugar .
I am a Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same thing as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ ants have whom , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think in sen@@ ti@@ ty of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months there has been a sharp rise in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , characterised by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , according to Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video split on YouTube held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on the basis of persecution from the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy acquired power and in 1925 assumed great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable arable land for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of trun@@ ks to diver@@ t the water from the Arab regions to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youths rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school , and 45 % had a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their native country of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes .
given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves an inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - are frustr@@ ated .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to talk of skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to keep silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we face black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold way .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account ine@@ qualities in her mind , which relate to the sex as well as the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my being in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , so@@ jour@@ ners compla@@ ined : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized creature in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their ego@@ centric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement still@@ ness , no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them of a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming ( eg@@ . : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment in which my life has neither passed nor ignored , nor is rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
within the framework of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
over the past 7 years Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has been travelling again and again - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special request for the region of Kurdist@@ an in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ falls Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keepers Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ ing@@ ale ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ spouse , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of her relationship there was a little time passed and the police said that her statement would be placed on the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos; informed ad@@ vert was useless .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make a refund at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who mi@@ stre@@ at them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence are reported to attend to law enforcement agencies .
contents 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ estimate Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , &quot; says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various sources and reports , which , however , do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the available numbers are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office issued 9@@ 600 advertisements on domestic violence . 70 % of it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the Peace Cour@@ ts . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements arrived .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; there are 9 women who will not do this on any woman in Paraguay because of psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately portra@@ y how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had liked Carlos so long and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain blame .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
it led a process against her former partner , who developed into an obsc@@ ure legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # pr@@ es ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non Intervention ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that it must be declared a perpet@@ ual criminal off@@ ence and to punish it harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the legislative text has been modified in some points in order to win even the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be lev@@ elled , which are currently banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill envis@@ aged that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence must present themselves , if they simply refuse to report and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts complic@@ ate themselves and contribute to the fact that the perpetrators are punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must refund so much until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered , among other things , a passage that the partners had called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ f@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media reported in Oman a year after a newspaper ban on attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked based on a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Afgh@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were arrested and tried in court , but later returned .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has been suffering the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the reign of the Sultan is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic secret services , the public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , limiting and torture of human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent paper published in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties holding hands of justice . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested at his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ an &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely , after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper is prohibited on any road , including online , starting on 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in Mas@@ kat in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 Afgh@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after having found the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
a b@@ ail was set up for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in the amount of 5000 Columbia Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the ICTY &apos;s judgment .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted al @-@ A@@ br@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j condemned to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari for six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , calls on the authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including court har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is done with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for locally @-@ managed medical research : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are lacking in the global healthcare system .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more severe consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home in order to support the Sam@@ bian health system .
Dr. War@@ rier , with Global Vo@@ ices , discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently working on a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be recipients , instead of being makers themselves .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you previously did not have ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the created access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that magazines produce articles only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ je@@ ales , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents protect not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain and car@@ tons . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security around the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but it now takes longer , as his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der that I have to ride down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is growing steadily in the USA and all over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red ro@@ mer@@ blade of the Out@@ red@@ je@@ ep variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it tests whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement came from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean that with their seed , they do not continue to do business and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders merely allow others who purchase their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden and / or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in greater cohesi@@ on such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and adop@@ ts the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ ging of chemicals in agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others , as opposed to patent seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that has become more and more restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all car@@ tons attributes are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or difficult .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale plants such as wheat are in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a Mat@@ ter of Vie@@ ws
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and endure threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary now than ever , as the altered conditions are much worse predic@@ able by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s spokesperson , C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this : waiting for 20 years , until a patent runs , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow on plants adapted to the am@@ ended environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
however , the major argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a secret of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for which the cultivation of large herds of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des is required , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , most of the smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .

Mor@@ ton believes that breeders would be more innovative through avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am stronger with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you have been protected from competition for 20 years , making it very easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
while the United States seems to be leaders in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , carries out an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crop varieties , the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; License , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation can not be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source seed systems , declares that the organization currently builds a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems for which scheduled start @-@ up will be scheduled for the next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has focused primarily on where and how something is cultivated and seed systems hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about the above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts on human rights in the region .
the Arabic network for human rights information remains true - despite this attack and the ridi@@ cul@@ ing of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who should defend the law in order to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network , for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web page lock@@ outs fell victim to . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to Egypt in the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles he writes for websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also given a home in Canada &apos;s blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and even if the blo@@ gging of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs and any other web site I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now , having locked it and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24th May to 6th August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at .
also documented the blocking of providers by transferring internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to further block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these actions in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers report in all of Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violent wave reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio released the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision like this :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . , but what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the paper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities committed by the police who first shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article published on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ ilia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
in memory , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong , according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has been high@@ lighting the security policy of the state for many years .
one of these security policy measures was the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning this led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , for some years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - the designation &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use means and means typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a week ago , the police launched the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus and the surrounding country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
in particular , the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations , have been committed to the killing of the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed by rebels outside Damascus , leading to the fact that inhabitants are locally produced or instructed by tunnels and control points of smu@@ g@@ gled food .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fungi do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been campaig@@ ning for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now becomes more and more known . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 4 , 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said to Global Vo@@ ices that they began the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from the regions &quot; before testing their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom grav@@ ey@@ ard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , car@@ ton , etc ) for obtaining new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured following the forest fires of October 15 and 16 . this led to the government to exp@@ el a state wall out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the provi@@ denti@@ al tragedy
the target of Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why the Civil Guard was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Union of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o there were roads and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a far reaching proposal on the form of roll forming the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ection@@ able by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced an e@@ asing of the law which allowed construction activity if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val carries on in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so decisive on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were unable to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed fires : the website counted more than half a million visitors .

in a night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat together in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner .
even if his mother did not tell it that way , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning the boy was to break up .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ le party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a couple of years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than himself to earn a living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af recalls in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ er left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran solely through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that due to relatively high unemployment rates , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers is housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted a request for asylum - what can be drawn up for months after regi@@ stering their asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible attitude helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including dres@@ s@@ makers , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals , however , go far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and target the country , which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along the way .
citizen report : Egypt &apos;s draft bill to shut down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been det@@ ained for more than 900 days .
he reported on the ev@@ ac@@ uation of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international sn@@ apshot showing challenges , wins and emerging trends in global internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviewed a bill which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users must be able to use the social networks within six months of submitting their full name and ID number within six months of the successful legislative decision .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the de@@ priv@@ ation of a criminal payment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty parliamentary members , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which the har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high civil servant would be introduced .
under the legislative proposal , however , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , legal experts of the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstr@@ ators demonstrating against the coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of elected President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a court date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the apparent burden of other weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a court martial in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist li@@ stens to si@@ fted documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would ensure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption indic@@ ted officer am@@ nesty , provided they return all illegal funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 th@@ rows a light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the attri@@ bution of his sources indicating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on May 09 .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
according to the new provisions of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
in the provisions , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within the social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the distribution of information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the state government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services for removing content and forcing them on request for the suspension of user data .
these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ stri@@ k@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as block in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave up , the site was blocked because it turned to &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to make a political diff@@ use campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
the UK can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
following this week &apos;s si@@ fted documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
