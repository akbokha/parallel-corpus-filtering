<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and practiced his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very swedish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigots person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, the Weltanschauung agreed not with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values they incarnate deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump was clearing his way to nominated Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, gave to a man - or perhaps because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters to be racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people said one of my friends is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">But you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to lift a man who looks at those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "", "as much as" "" "white against all other ethnics" "", "white and whiplash, which means" "" "whiplash" "", "as the big van Jones described has killed exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose, as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of America's white American promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they shouted and their voices got louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if anyone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vocal "NO!"</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero community have in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music bande) plays in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their abuse of drugs and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of Asunción's largest garbage dump in Paraguayan capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Clatura, where the recyclers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and a music teacher of the children of Clatura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same point where the parents worked in the trash The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio showed something he had never seen before: a violin made out of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live with him are the poorest - like the people in Clatura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork are successfully combating illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known then that this ship had already been involved in illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before the other coast of Africa was searching for.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on its shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorators, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishery authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia because of looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who then drove the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate contempt of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing had once been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail speed, with which information circulated between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely follow the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly, if they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue that the eight members of the HISH-i network lost each year due to the illegal fishermen who invade in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, imaginary names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-seamless organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a land could say," "" "You are not allowed to run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that have distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found refuge and found refuge.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing over great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">The Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, meaning that they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i find ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">In collaboration with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization, SkyTruth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project where a global system permits the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals, but also deterring them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had previously been exploited without a license and had hardly reckoned with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now posted a 33% increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats have purchased more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found trawl nets on board which were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined forces to form the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "With certainty, the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures develop in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia claimed his first great triumph: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also infiltrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works throughout the world.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They act as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's presidency.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Venezuelan government rejected the opposition's motion for a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into void by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recovery of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central North of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president Nicolás Maduro; in the end, however, the reluctance to re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rate are among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on 27 October.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil stripe and on 3rd November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that talk about confrontations, as well as reports of repression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves smote the news of police repression in the centrally located north-north town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise you could see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round, which renders the scale of repression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a ministry of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Mytys Media Labs:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado state that 1% of signatures are counterfeited.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your ministry!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and has tended to let the critical voices become silent:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches increasingly increase frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities of La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testifies to his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial ended on 24 August 2016 for crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was the Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Perla prison until 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quiños's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified to a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>

<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large lump of silver.</seg>

<seg id="238">I spun in and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>

<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They rarely caught a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured it with water and drove it a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license, last month witnessed a very mischievous translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "on a sign the Japanese word" "" "old car driver" "" "means" "" "older drivers" "", "wrongly - but also with malicious hind thoughts & # 8212; as" "" "awful motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levi, widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which has been published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable" "", "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the faulty English translation was initially removed. the term" "" "terrible drivers" "" "(German:" "" "awful motorists" "" ") was later replaced by the more appropriate, even if grammatically not quite correct term" elder drivers "" "" (German: "" "" older drivers "" ""). "" "</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture are sorry for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported how follows the excuses:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) from our side," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News talked about the phenomenon of "terrible" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, who are involved nationwide in accidents, is quite an occasion for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 cases of seniors were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors suffered 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen, the share of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In the version of the article published on Yahoo, the named reporter published comments on the light showing the prejudices that some Japanese seem to face against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on the translation error, among other things, received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills, in order to understand the source text and active language skills, in order to transfer him to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, searching for costs or the relatively low number of English speakers learning Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, nevertheless make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered the best, are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The proverted and enigmatic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate tee-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">The main site of the "Naval con Libertad" portal (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other users wrote that the internet websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also recorded photos of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups who oppose the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was mapped, and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenith: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet website.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered to @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEGAtro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online broadcasters. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by DNS, the server will respond in error or deny the request when entering such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We will confirm a DNS block: @ elongoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was discontinued on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV comrade Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="417">"" "the article is part of a series entitled" "" "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" "", "edited and re-published by Global Voices Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their minor son or her minor daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduation, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas, especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that crimped to the Criaditas is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family whose daughter is in the belief that she will complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with her and justifies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never find out about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households, received a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent beatings. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira arrived on a stick to Marín until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo deep in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they called the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows than children are registered," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to hurt the rights of children unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a speedy investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before the court, the case of Carolina Marín may be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Criadazgo is in court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, purified the refrigerator, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over she went home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make supper for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to go hungry, but didn't get unlimited food. "I could get more books from the house's library as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings, the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought she was intelligent, but didn't talk to her." "" "the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would" "" "get bad habits" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for her, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was, however, fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Alvarenga has also been discriminated against in the school. "one thing that is almost never spoken is bullying and the harassments that are exposed to Criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to come home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of everything, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="503">When it is accepted by the Parliament, users of social media must be registered in Egypt by a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be established, which is intended to give citizens permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site with their correct names and identity ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs and cursed in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video alignment and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose their registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, member of Parliament and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the Telecommunications Ministry to come through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network.</seg>

<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), said Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they violently control physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft "stands in accordance with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration on the image surface is present," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atom disaster in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a prefecture in Japan's north-east, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to be evacuated because the tsunami had destroyed entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">For this reason, the Fukushima prefecture had an atomic accident, already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement homes (in the) Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the greatest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fukushima forms 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of shelters from Behelfsshelters (in the Caucasia, Kazetsu juutaku) is still to be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the people evacuated from Fukushima were still living in emergency shelters while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated refugees who were residing after the disaster in accommodation were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">According to the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by disaster have reopened its doors by December 2016, accounting for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident took part in the three prefectures of agrarian land in large areas.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are lying in the "nuclear plywood zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but here again Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants make it difficult to earn a living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she questioned her about the status of the reconstruction and also how her empathy towards the tsunami-risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that there is still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuates from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63,000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture of 160 000 evacuates from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people returned to Fukushima in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 budget, some 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima are still living outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes most of the evacuated people are older than 50 years old. they are known to be more known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive building projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="617">The Euro MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to forgo violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again Brazilian media have slipped street protests by directing the focus to another, unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>

<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a fire-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">You must also recognise this if you are strictly against any kind of damage.</seg>

<seg id="625">The villages forgotten by the abindustralization in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso Act, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular village of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as the Central - on Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After getting ready, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period of time are in operation since they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers precisely that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane manufacturers were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 centres per pound, according to the 2016 edition of "Agricultural Effects" published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said that the factory was shut down, not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially written documents, which were only distinguished from the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, awaits retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, whose construction it helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work sheet set has been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the employment and services generated by the plants in the congregations where they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during Mammut's speech of 21 October 2002, the then President saw in the eyes of the present persons, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the popular community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to discourage them, they also stopped to asphale the road, this disadvantaged other farms too.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without future prospects, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant continue to be impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop increases that the young participants in talks like" "" "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance," "" "or whatever happens to them." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the strain of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to keep my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">In this way, they can grow and also go ahead of our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they have determined by the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and proponent of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also contributes and inserts the verse in syllables (which is also published on his blog and is now reissued with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes at almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanguu (in the evening, "plastic models of dishes") of each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the canton of Kappabashi, there are a number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film maker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend reverses them today in conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanguu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone strips decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were converted to mosquito nets, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an emperor-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we made for the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone booths and mobile phone designers will allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone-stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further quirky plastic courts can be viewed at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # (), in the #, in a well-known version.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which devotes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missed and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "apilling a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learning with drug trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and therefore entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear changes life" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">One main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches secret tombs after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews in just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday, we are again preparing ourselves today for the task that we have placed before and search for graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come by newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is opposed or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The seriousness of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were "soaking."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies when they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"" "Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" "" "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family was sacked with threats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never dies, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because they don't know when they will deceive or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these horrible days I asked myself if wines would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us he needed to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life is made of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years earlier when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizen's Council for Public Security and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "apilling a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tormented the country in the last four decades in an understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has emerged the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of accurate reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Authorities described a fireball containing dozens of houses including a cinema close to people who were full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to unrecognizably.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "That's Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of that day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been taken over several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count dead bodies," "" "said a man of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted graphically.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">Indeed, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has been documenting orders for Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments like this example falsely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash report, published by the United Nations describes those who could escape strikes, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that falsely claimed that Myanmar's Than being a monk and politician involved in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. additionally, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news website wrongly claimed that the President of Myanmar was admitted by Than in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now deleted, Roman Catholic news site Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it is a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacres of the Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the massacres of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times), but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence associated with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot believe these images any longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images have desensitize readers and viewers and empower them to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture is suggesting something, which can actually be used in terms of context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each investigation of false attributions should also take into account how internationally they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others, deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression does not suffice, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu language version, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Imagine your parents in recognition of how they care for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunsellor language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness you feel after getting angry in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defy other cultures, reveal other forms of thought and awaken our curiosity.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They exert me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways. but somehow all of us are put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who do not fit in there, will be removed.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi Arabian, Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are being fought and human beings have been encircled by the creation of the "other" in public performance, was even a scientist of Stanford four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions, according to the role of being aware and unconsciously the "other"; as my girlfriend and I have been doing in the rain during the Women's March because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honor the diversity of languages from major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often to it," "" "these events are instead" "" "listening to, feeling, feeling" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers write their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation lead to the audience listening to them.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story-narrator Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamus tells the fable from hares and the baboon in the Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamara asks:" "" "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers are hoping to extend it. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017; the march started with the puertorious Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went off to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences and Barbara Rühling, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here royalty-free, contains a series of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the Introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked alongside this page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information whatsoever about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of sometimes extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in detention for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police had taken Bassel as a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, they were contacted by persons who presented themselves to be the insider of the Assad government and notified them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the surrounding public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Earth, a designer, technologiologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project created by Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more proactive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations, and here Greek-Roman architecture mixes with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work, IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">He taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught fellow prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting, a bill that she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants for displeasure of 54 million Metikal (some 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the Mozambique airports, whose Council presided over Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for its resumption to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward in regard to the efforts of our legal system," "" "said CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to note is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the repulsion.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company seemed to be silent, however, and did not induce appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be an adviser after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid presentations and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza likes to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refuted!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director has no moral whatsoever:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks moral means to return and to serve the state * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served himself solely by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a hand it turned out to be an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Mahel prison not only to be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, cutting-edge and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "in burmesan Scripture" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely connotation connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several Burmese words with basically different meanings, which have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The faceboofutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' like this:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence ku la -" "" "Healing" "" "+ the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that she will lessen hate speech radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before deleting all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write to Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words opposite.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting axes).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who propagate hate speech, receive a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propagates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to clean, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "did not meet Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and thus banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "facebook automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to take control of hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements striving to abolish laws for children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. without a doubt, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for instance, had no qualms about telling the critics of the childhood that they were to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the child marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained it - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the President of the country has to agree and let the law proclaim." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators announced a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted again on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one opposed it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Member Lovell Francis, a member of the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has taken too much time and unnecessary talk which has disguised the core of the matter, but do you know what? the toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, a member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-ready age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on amending the law was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies voted against have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer permitted.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...)</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be passed, and he seems to deliver on his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said that it was quite lawful when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished for the debate on the subject in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Instead of talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem that we are inviting the state into our bedroom, we would simply talk about it that the state, our daughters, protects that it may be abused by large, hard-boiled men who are opposed to them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child is legal or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws which prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, obscured internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-versed Internet users are used to using circumvention tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several mirror sites (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now available.</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to copy snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents on a decentralised and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as Wikileror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further guides the inquiry to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlending rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation assists him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist village of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was in and I immediately began to crackle the pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood face to face with Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book was released. he immediately sat down, we look at him and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the advancement of Neptune's nature and wildlife, however, is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to shoot in the Bardia National Park recordings of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist shelters.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid speaking the names of their husbands or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, get this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state Odisha by a mock court and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives is also common among men. however, they do not have to fear much less remittances if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel as well as housewives, played a unique club, thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs available in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her panel discussion was women who do not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not speaking out loud the names of their husbands is a custom which they all duly uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try out at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we can't tell the names of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought about their husbands" name, "" "" says Rohini Pawas from Walhe village in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, she just chucked in front of herself; another decided to let the whole infected frustration come out against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their husbands at their names.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put to the women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation created violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, showing the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "I said to my husband that I would bear the" "" "zinnoberred dot" "" "if he did it also." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I listened to carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discus club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discus club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Sala-Kurta, a wide shirt about a pair of trousers, they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion lap so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly into the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have made only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but then stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only when they are alone and not other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discus club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I'm it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and a part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they had been used to make use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a single man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC explained.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassination for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN in 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of single-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mordecabala, province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has given cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head had power, generating wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably only recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China referred to Lius Case as an" "" "an internal affair" "" "and a spokesman said that he deemed it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to release appeals from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or to give him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some of the reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations had to put pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about the release of Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a shock after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for a unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States (USA)</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad informed us that the Americans" "" "wish him the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as it helps him with his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman in the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June the news agency AFP that the embassy requests the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy's invitation drew a furious response from China, with the foreign ministry's statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley stated that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, which it claims according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a ruling in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I urge China to release Nobel laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally so that he can enter a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing's Reuters news agency reported that China had great concerns whether the fuss about Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada, Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be taken care of by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu attorney previously told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom of expression.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry asked China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Liu on 27 June and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the governing Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged as I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, Charter 08 signed for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised on an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, as compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one hears that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which the political system of Singapore could not be measured with other "normal countries" in view of that, it seemed inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred corresponding questions in a rational way with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">When Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review breaks the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam" "" "credulously committed a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are seen only as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister need to pay back bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade is tending to affirm, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country above all" "" "etc, but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification mostly follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may be wary of rage when they are kept for Americans, but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little difference between us and Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a principal property of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink brillenframe and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. Ramírez tells, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, buy them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghurchbeard) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children back there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the circuit," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil previously and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup of Soccer.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he said, smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her that their guests often send text messages when they have continued to greet them or to report on their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken refuge in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travelers seek quiet telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy about her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma, she leaves a lot of photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, as she pretends to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Ya Spanish Fueron, repeats it every time. "you've gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-in for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter user from the end of the year</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi got a cell phone alert in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, authorities must also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after installing the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications on digital censorship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often submit extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China," published by censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police inspectors checked the inhabitants indiscriminately whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang-App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Furthermore, a Jingwang product description, from which the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive, has also published a Jingwang product description.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minimise the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">An up-to-date report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">On 27 June, the authorities in Xinjiang issued a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian Rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slings to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the uppermost floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyewitnesses (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he hates a special aversion against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee from the second generation."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he poured in water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot Junitday has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking, the gap of lukewarm coffee and the cheeks of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">The Ministry of Interior has recently canceled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub told CNN that the concert "just" was cancelled due to the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila regarded the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement would probably not be simply silken rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly obvious emerging reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib fell victim to traditional sexual organs by aborting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently set-down unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of "honours of honour" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be held in prison for an indefinite period of time, and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee from the family are often necessary for the woman to take nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been regarded as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was fed into politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are at the core politically can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated conspicuously often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words, "that can get what you want" - be it belief or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember later that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinions were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but it was only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuanda, a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory, thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuanda, who later was to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can we not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the educational network, arguing that commentaries in social media are critical of the problems associated with deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has resisted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's what Hdaib sees - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will awaken to genuine and fundamental frankness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and on artificial nature. at least he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as it is, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to Fellow as a student.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in many regions of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebat Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we had a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time now: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Yet for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebula festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and body care have rarely been as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth off crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima's capital, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of the region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts face each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks of them, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of receiving bad advice a training in hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district on which we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel alienated to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga donated by the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cartas por la-liación campaign (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, which needed most urgent consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves to the way they had done earlier to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter carried me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut where the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life somebody wrote something like that, so I answer." "" "suddenly tears ran across the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was too tired of war, sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something different from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">As a prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice helped the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following a letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were made aware that after disarmament, peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, to rise up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken over the international headlines several months ago, after reports published to address the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2253">After having experienced a group of Tschetschenen from the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear for her life, she went to the USA in the last analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day someone told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While trying to help her, someone I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen Friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya that can eliminate this disgrace?"</seg>

<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what ailments were you laid in - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there's my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets at the top, others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put my SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe you're in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know what hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to figure out how to look at the person they remember from their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"" "" "" "I talked to someone who has been locked in argun for one and a half months." ""</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not complete a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Cadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, but purposefully submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was in the process when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports to this date. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, before 2003 I was already known all over the world, when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to approach the" "" "civilising" "", "but finally pushed us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia Law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defense of Sharia never even jammed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes in front of you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrov came to the Plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at first looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic is constantly worsening.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I occured sugar.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same thing as Chetschenen, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dageants have whom, the cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think in sentity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, characterised by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, according to Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video split on YouTube held the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on the basis of persecution from the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region where a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy acquired power and in 1925 assumed great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable arable land for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of trunks to divert the water from the Arab regions to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youths rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school, and 45% had a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their native country of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves an intersectional feminists - are frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to talk of skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we face black women in a twofold way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account inequalities in her mind, which relate to the sex as well as the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my being in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, sojourners complained:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized creature in a historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric programme." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement stillness, no matter how many black women try to instruct them of a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming (eg.: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment in which my life has neither passed nor ignored, nor is rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abridged and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of course. the article belongs to the series # PorSermujer (# weightingale), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-spouse, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship there was a little time passed and the police said that her statement would be placed on the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, the Ada Báez 'informed advert was useless.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make a refund at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who mistreat them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence are reported to attend to law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents 1 Strikes and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not underestimate Paraguayan laws: good approach, poor implementation punches and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, "says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay." there are various sources and reports, which, however, do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney Office issued 9600 advertisements on domestic violence. 70% of it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the Peace Courts. here, too, 86% of women's advertisements arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2499">Since women's murder is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately portray how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. this should be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had liked Carlos so long and didn't leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian's case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against her former partner, who developed into an obscure legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed at the Paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# pres).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non Intervention) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law stipulates that it must be declared a perpetual criminal offence and to punish it harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"" "" "" "thus, the legislative text has been modified in some points in order to win even the deputies for the law, who feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions would be levelled, which are currently banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."

<seg id="2533">The original bill envisaged that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence must present themselves, if they simply refuse to report and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethink must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered, among other things, a passage that the partners had called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Afghan authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn for reporting on corruption in the sultante.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he served a one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri were arrested and tried in court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he had dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has been suffering the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The reign of the Sultan is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular the domestic secret services, the public freedoms, including freedom of the press, limiting and torture of human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disruption of public order, abuse of the Internet, and "undermining of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 Afghan Rial (7800 US dollars). moreover, a one-year professional ban was imposed on both journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after having found the use of "an information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">A bail was set up for Al-Abri in the amount of 5000 Columbia Rial (13 000 US dollars) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the ICTY's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted al-Abri at a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj condemned to a year and Al-Maamari for six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six-month prison sentence from prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the court's decision to allow Azamn again, the newspaper still faces attacks by the government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement, in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, with which the Minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appeal to allow the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been violated the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the omanic authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR, calls on the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj will release immediately and unconditionally;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is done with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for locally-managed medical research: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are lacking in the global healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, helps build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home in order to support the Sambian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">Dr. Warrier, with Global Voices, discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently working on a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be recipients, instead of being makers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you previously did not have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the created access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines produce articles only against payment (the so-called "Paywall") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredjeales, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents protect not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain and cartons. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton is still breeding a salad, but it now takes longer, as his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like lying in a river a boulder that I have to ride down." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is growing steadily in the USA and all over the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and eaten red romerblade of the Outredjeep variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. it tests whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement came from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "open source" "" "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that with their seed, they do not continue to do business and sell it. "open source" breeders merely allow others who purchase their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden and / or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says, and adopts the ever-increasing mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are the merging of chemicals in agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others, as opposed to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that has become more and more restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartons attributes are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that large-scale plants such as wheat are in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Views</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and endure threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary now than ever, as the altered conditions are much worse predicable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto's spokesperson, Carly Scaduto, acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts the notion that intellectual property restricts other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing the public with more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this: waiting for 20 years, until a patent runs, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow on plants adapted to the amended environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the major argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patented plant features: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a secret of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for which the cultivation of large herds of herbicides is required, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, most of the smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads at his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative through avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am stronger with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties themselves in a few years, "he says." with a patent, you have been protected from competition for 20 years, making it very easy in my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the United States seems to be leaders in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, carries out an open-source seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crop varieties, the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organisation agreements" "" "Open-Source" "" "License, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation can not be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticised this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts on human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic network for human rights information remains true - despite this attack and the ridiculing of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, who should defend the law in order to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network, for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web page lockouts fell victim to. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is no access to Egypt in the blog of the columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles he writes for websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he established to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which is also given a home in Canada's blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blogging of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs and any other web site I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, having locked it and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24th May to 6th August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etiletat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Also documented the blocking of providers by transferring internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to further block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these actions in court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers report in all of Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "" "thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airwaves to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violent wave reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio released the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which it announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc., but what happens only in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the paper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities committed by the police who first shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article published on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecilia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues against the violence as a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is wrong, according to Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrates per federal state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In particular, Globo, the largest media company in South America, has been highlighting the security policy of the state for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these security policy measures was the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police force and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning this led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, for some years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - the designation "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and means typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">"" "" "" "a week ago, the police launched the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman." ""</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, in Damascus and the surrounding country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">In particular, the East Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition, based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations, have been committed to the killing of the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been besieged by rebels outside Damascus, leading to the fact that inhabitants are locally produced or instructed by tunnels and control points of smuggled food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been campaigning for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now becomes more and more known. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila at Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, September 4, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said to Global Voices that they began the "production of fungal seeds coming from the regions" before testing their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom graveyard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured following the forest fires of October 15 and 16. this led to the government to expel a state wall out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so decisive on this fateful weekend in October that the servers were unable to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed fires: the website counted more than half a million visitors.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalls in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharer left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Asharaf was homeless, ran solely through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy people.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that due to relatively high unemployment rates, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers is housed in more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "this is improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted a request for asylum - what can be drawn up for months after registering their asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible attitude helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis Success Story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of Afghans have emerged, including dressmakers, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Ashark's goals, however, go far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and target the country, which he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "thus, they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans along the way.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, wins and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament reviewed a bill which foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must be able to use the social networks within six months of submitting their full name and ID number within six months of the successful legislative decision.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months "imprisonment or the deprivation of a criminal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty parliamentary members, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which the harsher penalties for the insult of the president or a high civil servant would be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the legislative proposal, however, such action would be punished with prison and fines, legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstrators demonstrating against the coup that led to the inauguration of elected President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 participants who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree on the apparent burden of other weapons, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a court martial in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of the pro-Morsi seat blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist listens to sifted documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has mainly been interrogated by the President of the Republic, who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would ensure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption indicted officer amnesty, provided they return all illegal funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on April 21 throws a light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denied the attribution of his sources indicating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on May 09.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new provisions of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the provisions, it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within the social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>

<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services for removing content and forcing them on request for the suspension of user data.</seg>

<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication gave up, the site was blocked because it turned to "an information source that collaborates with groups to make a political diffuse campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
