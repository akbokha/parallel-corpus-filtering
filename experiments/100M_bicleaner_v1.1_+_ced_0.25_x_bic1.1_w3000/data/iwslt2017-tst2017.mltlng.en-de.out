that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally belonged to Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if it cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
so , from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to cracks .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failing and ris@@ king the statements , it could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly worried about his telephone calls ,
just like its email data , financial and bank information , its credit information , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security had the result that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ renowned Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer provide information secretly , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to kill mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
or a wall street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis . or a wall street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect all of our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to provide an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to give an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Spanish law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how clients , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others waiting for the next release nerv@@ ously , and the next documents revealed .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do what is going on ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for major public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and expos@@ ing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bund@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the US .
presumably , because so far there were no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations , this scandal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information , less information is required to form a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed dec@@ ei@@ vers to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Bar firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that all up to one lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers joined us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to anyone but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to regard this as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through which corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability are established .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
it may sound very foolish as if we could not do anything about it ; as though nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot has begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU registers in central registers at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a ticket sale .
one guy stayed in the red Maz@@ da and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild alien is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aking at the door to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my view completely .
maybe the people who were sold as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
it was normal for me to host people on my air mattress . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can create fear in fun .
I wrote Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and created so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell to the castle , Brian and me star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ek@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you will be aware of the things you can do . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who never met before .
can design be such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I &apos;d like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this silent approach of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who actually now has Al G@@ ores mobile phone ?
could you please tell Twitter that he is running for the President &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you some of the discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how can his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you had 150 assessments , all of which say , &quot; He can really hold very well un@@ locked mobil@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning , we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
little surprising is that we trust people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if one has less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good reputation stands out in common . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell me too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m doing my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need which had not been covered before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed part@@ ying parties or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with my customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the forefront when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for people do not trust one another .
when trust works , it is possible to create wonderful things .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting positions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay will take place .
but these relations behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a question of economic commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s simply not just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the matter is not just . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group of Ans@@ wers would wait to fill up a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood of a pub that you have never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already started .
were now offered residents . students looking for a lead ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programmes were launched ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , overnight 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality there was also before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why has it just worked ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that with the components of trust you can find the right design .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ resses , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply delay the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ st me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist girl@@ friends were app@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , with the pressure I felt as the 17 year old to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone tru@@ sts you fully understands you , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should I do this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects .
the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and begin the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as we walked in silence -- as we walked in silence -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time feared to be recognized as Muslims .
we went this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims and sm@@ ashed in the open air .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain oneself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces available , but do not stop the terror .
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to more tolerance of people with other fai@@ ths , and showing greater participation in civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in Washington D.@@ C. recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radi@@ cal@@ isation , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imag@@ inations when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality to read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual man with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger , it was a main objective of the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m made the connection to God and their church again .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is affecting me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , con@@ formity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when test persons present messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather vo@@ iced military attacks on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you see when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an experienced young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled my shoes off , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was stopping me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congreg@@ ations were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion from pan@@ i@@ cking and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ talk , a thin@@ ker with deep drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when humans appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air package delivery to our social consciousness penet@@ rated , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , air units can achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , and determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on highest level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star @-@ wing@@ ed @-@ gl@@ ers , it can ho@@ ver , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a sweeping side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts , which assemble to hurt you .
decades ago , pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft flying only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with only one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote control unit . it was invented recently .
it only has a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ roads , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room .
but it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it flying , I have to throw it right .
the probability of just throwing it right when everyone watches me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the bu@@ d is an exercise in con@@ no@@ isse@@ urs , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the full capacity ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is directed or even rotating as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us look at this .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise direction .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller is falling out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly even if limited .
we will demonstrate this by un@@ le@@ ashing a half .
the last demonstration uses artificial s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a pal@@ let of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread - and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled each other in a far distant gal@@ axy , turning the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for this short moment they lit lighter than any stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally talk about black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life had just sprung up on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to solve some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes pier@@ ced through the ground .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my to@@ dd@@ ly father .
in fact , they were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their signals meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gravity is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and the other is dra@@ ined .
for illustration , lec@@ turers often lead a really al@@ ber@@ y dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched when the waves struck . an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . this is why the Lig@@ o staff declared that they were crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be precisely measured on less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to assert that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength far smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you by several points .
it &apos;s different with sounds .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example , your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
when the two bodies rotate very quickly , one hears the same cir@@ pen with an additional key change . that sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement of movement , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ aming noise &#93; No one who knows what to hear , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling around hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
in this there is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe , as it was never before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through , as these are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen , that we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes , so to speak , are the no@@ is@@ les for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the birth of the stars , and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the universe &apos;s noise and cir@@ cus .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before whom I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on television ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of was my fear eliminated .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expectedly kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is called all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valu@@ ables &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a star@@ tling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , stir up your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
I do TV , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days at four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production four , 16 episodes : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are shows that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I say it to you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work , so you understand that I am not just lying on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s like I put troops on as I painted on a canvas .
as if one supports a high sound , run a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the tot@@ ality .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does .
but the hum@@ ming -- when I began with television production , when I began to work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the tot@@ ality is action and activity . the tot@@ um is a drug .
the tot@@ ality is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you can not strive other than size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called the tot@@ ality .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s a genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not do@@ omed , and I just know that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the hum@@ ming .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her m@@ um is a single work institution .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the bu@@ zz of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the tot@@ ality and the tot@@ ality I was .
so what do you do if what you do is the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ha@@ y yourself , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you work , you love to be a teacher , to be a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the hum@@ ming once you stop the hum@@ ming , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become conscious :
first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; Evalu@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my hum@@ ming shri@@ mps , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically out of the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of balance , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , soft voices , al@@ ig@@ ning pen@@ cils and the song in which it is letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door rises and an energy boost is coming in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens that it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the titanium bu@@ zz , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sums are no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the tot@@ ality is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , because which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it &apos;s law , I don &apos;t have any other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as spar@@ se to me as to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better than being a house ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst the soap bubbles .
in doing so , I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day dre@@ amer .
you probably right , but you can do it also !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and talk to my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the Year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , more it doesn &apos;t need .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own kids . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to out@@ do myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sums are not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my tot@@ ality .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clearly my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I listen to the sums . the country I created , the marathon , I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life within me is wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel that sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I raise you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I &apos;m a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
for sure , they have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; an electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circuits so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , one has to reduce the internal pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from tissue damage is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly shared themselves and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing , however , is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we planted them at the point of receipt of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re@@ incar@@ n@@ ate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ ff@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor @-@ motor field in the motor @-@ motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found out much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore it with humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; father Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great success@@ ors in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed when it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , China &apos;s Communist Party , and even the Euro Group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies will be m@@ owed , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt throwing his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is too afraid to invest where it would be productive and bring income where it would be productive and produce income with which you could waste the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate stock prices and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
his exceedingly wast@@ eful kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we see under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and decisive , giving them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal weigh@@ ting in questions of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long held . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that lights up very bright , it is burnt out quickly .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , and the economy gradually ero@@ ded politics and dis@@ ma@@ yed them .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my dispute with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of predat@@ ors , who so last@@ ingly decim@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that they star@@ ve at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that har@@ ms politicians so far that it itself har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ prov@@ oked economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political assets are de@@ valued , the inequality rising , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; demos &quot; from democracy , the higher will the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keeps control as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look odd .
the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ shing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring Hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve humans and people are putting their energy into exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it need , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ style utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; @-@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples soon .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital is following you from one place to another , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one works , is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all revenues from capital and income come from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please make a short note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the net income of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which they prefer privileged people , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as the liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers den@@ ies as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely confused . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t mess , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very gre@@ ek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to associate liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the euro zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent denial that a massive fault line ran through the euro zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have still chosen denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what are you looking for ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ eus ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions going through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the un@@ released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to make the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will be as detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price most of you have never heard , even though he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studio ,
Amazon &apos;s TV production company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an i@@ gel@@ aar and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a highly competitive industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left hand side , here at this end , are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to provide &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean dis@@ continuation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the print is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon prints out things for nothing , do you intervene , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when looking at these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process them , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7,5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a little different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they show the shows , the course of which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic means that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the minimum you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so far , this is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody here know the multi @-@ health system ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , it can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always generating the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can predict explo@@ sions of the flu , the bad type , by data analysis - by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success was cul@@ min@@ ating in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked imp@@ ec@@ cable , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work any more ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was another sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life - at work , in the enforcement of law , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , you dis@@ integrate this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a branch you put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all own it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s pieces and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , for which they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions first when competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe choice because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to avoid this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
I have made a few decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have heard in hind@@ sight to the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off , make decisions to be an expert in what you do and risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
