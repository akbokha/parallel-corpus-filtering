<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally belonged to Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if it cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped to cracks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and risking the statements, it could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly worried about his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its email data, financial and bank information, its credit information, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security had the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">This technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-renowned Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer provide information secretly, and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it's up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to kill misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Or a wall street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis. or a wall street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to provide an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to give an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Spanish law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how clients, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others waiting for the next release nervously, and the next documents revealed.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do what is going on?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for major public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by a few to hide and disguise their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and exposing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapu.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bundles.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because so far there were no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information, less information is required to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed deceivers to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 Bar firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us that all up to one lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers joined us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to anyone but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to regard this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through which corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very foolish as if we could not do anything about it; as though nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls it." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally finish the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a ticket sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">One guy stayed in the red Mazda and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get in there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaking at the door to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">It was normal for me to host people on my air mattress. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote Brian Chesky to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and created so" "" "air mattress and breakfast" "" "[AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese-ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell to the castle, Brian and me stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleekczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you will be aware of the things you can do. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually now has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell Twitter that he is running for the President's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you some of the discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how can his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments, all of which say, "He can really hold very well unlocked mobiles!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising is that we trust people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">"" "" "" "a good reputation stands out in common." ""</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell me too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother." "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Great works of art in your home! I'm doing my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed partying parties or ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with my customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people do not trust one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it is possible to create wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting positions." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay will take place.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a question of economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it's simply not just" "" "rental industry" "", "the matter is not just." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group of Answers would wait to fill up a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood of a pub that you have never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already started.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. incubator programmes were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, overnight 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that with the components of trust you can find the right design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppresses, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces available, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to more tolerance of people with other faiths, and showing greater participation in civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in Washington D.C. recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation, one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family so that the extremists can make a brainwashing that leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imaginations when they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>

<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality to read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual man with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger, it was a main objective of the instrumentalization of extremists that promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia is affecting me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when test persons present messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they rather voiced military attacks on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you see when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain themselves.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled my shoes off, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw was stopping me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregations were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had taken courage and compassion from panicking and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before air package delivery to our social consciousness penetrated, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, air units can achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulences and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, and determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be" "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "" "on highest level." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most star-winged-glers, it can hover, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which assemble to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft flying only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying is working with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossroads, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">But it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it flying, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of just throwing it right when everyone watches me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the bud is an exercise in connoisseurs, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the full capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is directed or even rotating as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller is falling out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by unleashing a half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses artificial swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread - and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a far distant galaxy, turning the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit lighter than any stars together in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally talk about black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life had just sprung up on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genius, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometry gravitational-wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run to solve some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes pierced through the ground.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my toddly father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In fact, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their signals measurable signals for 23 years. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and the other is drained.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers often lead a really albery dance in courses on the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched when the waves struck. an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by 1. this is why the Ligo staff declared that they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be precisely measured on less than one thousandth of the radius of a atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to assert that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength far smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you by several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">It's different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">When the two bodies rotate very quickly, one hears the same cirpen with an additional key change. that sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of movement, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [surrenaming noise] No one who knows what to hear, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling around hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen, that we will never see and of whom we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes, so to speak, are the noisles for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the birth of the stars, and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the universe's noise and circus.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "before whom I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of was my fear eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, is called all" "" "valuables" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>

<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the Beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "yes" "" "to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, stir up your life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days at four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shows that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I speak of work, so you understand that I am not just lying on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say that it's not about dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I put troops on as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if one supports a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the totality.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the humming -- when I began with television production, when I began to work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totality is action and activity. the totum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totality is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you can not strive other than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the totality.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not doomed, and I just know that I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there are, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the humming. I am the humming.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mum is a single work institution.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "guess, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the totality and the totality I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Hay yourself, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do, you do, you work, you love to be a teacher, to be a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you know the humming once you stop the humming, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become conscious:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me "Evaluate."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "it calls no more" "" "estimation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my humming shrimps, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically out of the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of balance, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, soft voices, aligning pencils and the song in which it is letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door rises and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens that it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the titanium buzz, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totality is the stream that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, because which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">"" "once my child wants to play with me, I will say" "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I don't have any other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as sparse to me as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person is better than being a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst the soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naive, for a day dreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably right, but you can do it also!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>

<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I'm a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">For sure, they have one of the most well-known, the "deep-brain stimulation." an electrode is implanted in the brain in order to influence the neurons' circuits so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in skull-brain traumas, the brain swells and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one has to reduce the internal pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from tissue damage is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared themselves and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellar cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we planted them at the point of receipt of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reincarnate these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouffler, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor-motor field in the motor-motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the explantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore it with humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "father Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great successors in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "indeed, democracy dwindles with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me that democracy would be abolished when it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, China's Communist Party, and even the Euro Group are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies will be mowed, our future bleak and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt throwing his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is too afraid to invest where it would be productive and bring income where it would be productive and produce income with which you could waste the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate stock prices and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not equalled by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly wasteful kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we see under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and decisive, giving them the right to political co-determination with equal weighting in questions of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy has not long held." ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights up very bright, it is burnt out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies don't have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, and the economy gradually eroded politics and dismayed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my dispute with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators, who so lastingly decimated the animals from which it feeds, that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that harms politicians so far that it itself harms itself by the self-provoked economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political assets are devalued, the inequality rising, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism expels the "demos" from democracy, the higher will the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "keeps control as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look odd.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring Hyperautocracy, which lets the film" "" "Matrix" "" "appear like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Star Trek," in which machines serve humans and people are putting their energy into exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it need, how could it look like this "Star Trek" -style utopia instead of the "matrix "-like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples soon.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital is following you from one place to another, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one works, is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and income come from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there that the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make a short note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "Cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the net income of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberal, in which they prefer privileged people, and Marxian because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or are we going to sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as the libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers denies as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>

<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill -</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price most of you have never heard, even though he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studio,</seg>
<seg id="1042">Amazon's TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an igelaar and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a highly competitive industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left hand side, here at this end, are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to provide "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean discontinuation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon prints out things for nothing, do you intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you jump over or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact they collect the data, process them, and this is the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landed at 7,5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they show the shows, the course of which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "house of Cards" "". "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic means that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so far, this is a bit frightening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody here know the multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, it can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always generating the best results. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can predict explosions of the flu, the bad type, by data analysis - by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success was culminating in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked impeccable, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work any more,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was another sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life - at work, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you disintegrate this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a branch you put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it's pieces and pieces to be put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, for which they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions first when competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe choice because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and to avoid this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made a few decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have heard in hindsight to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off, make decisions to be an expert in what you do and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
