Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your look at the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a pit chapel , where the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is excav@@ ated .
small farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone who had to get upset about this because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was a green meadow instead of a stra@@ pping road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and congreg@@ ations have changed since the 19th century in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheets have been incorporated for cities and municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were developed according to the Bavarian survey administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the early 18@@ 00@@ s during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops mar@@ ched off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ische Bureau . &quot;
the fact sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all other documents on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is situated in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and figures appears : hand @-@ written , numbered fl@@ ur@@ ries from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots show no farmers there today - but farmers in the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October Festival , was in the 19th century indeed a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Journal sheet , one reads not only the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; street names in the area of the current district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created there in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with King Ludwig II &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients there was first place , later on 500 places were extended .
at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychiat@@ ri@@ ties in Germany , has been located there since 2006 .
in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural style based on the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn course will take place .
with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to promote coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination complaints , as well as the state law enforcement authorities , who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately targeting minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warnings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of citizens &apos; rights which happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ ander died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the voyage through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are hal@@ ted 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready if they bring deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws which obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further race pro@@ visi@@ oning in the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently stak@@ eholder groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ sh@@ au@@ n @-@ Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac made a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the voting court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insight into his company , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and equally many kit@@ tens and houses in five apartments holiday @-@ houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests there is only regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t profit from such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grass@@ land provision ensures a lot of work , a lot must be dealt with with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental business and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not conduct bio@@ energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about its leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers must be supported at costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the area could be dra@@ fted for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants .
this means that the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ warded until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half of the leader was funded , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and land@@ ladies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Policy ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the f@@ enced area must not be cat@@ chy ( slope of over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots involving nearly 16 kilometres of fence is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ bach electric fence project 2018 .
the open @-@ air space corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the sur@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s suggestions for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have killed him if he had done it .
but he attacked its meaning , and in particular the meaning attributed to it , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus from 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the Statue of Liberty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance on Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your crowded masses , longing to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus and her friends who were campaig@@ ning to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the links between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical pic@@ torial representation .
Laz@@ arus also changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has stum@@ bled upon something here .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite hatred that is their only source of power .
2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ oses Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Great Britain team
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship club will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something very special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected captain of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it &apos;s &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir goes on this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot@@ sman to watch after a great season , which included victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell team .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also join the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
being so special about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb po@@ di@@ ums .
concerning my speech as captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long before the newspapers hit him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led as sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very smart to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort rather than a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control items or arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ cked by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable por@@ to had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters hit his lead .
and even back then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the Am@@ ity Treaty , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ sent and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player home to South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was taken from the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy to see how it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer dead due to passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer people have died due to passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said coordinator Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the head of the construction station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which again and again hin@@ ders the construction work , is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers against red lights and shut @-@ off grids is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were fed by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the rest@@ less Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the cab@@ al is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a roof@@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 5@@ pm in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch government quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island .
the journey involves a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and out of corru@@ gated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has wood resources valued at a value of $ 78 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Papua people who make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an@@ ese demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal country in the 1970 &quot; s were genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week accidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources deliver an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are struggling to keep up with it .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local ports , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai Muslim who went to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua ( their market ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 bor@@ ou@@ ghs of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts have broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights on .
one of the soldiers increased their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and sm@@ ote the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command@@ o centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ bows and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - running in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and asked the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the exec@@ utions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said reports that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because it was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman for the police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filmed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the next day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he established an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said he had no plans to establish a mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alle@@ gations with fi@@ erc@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 other people were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that revenge will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the Police Bri@@ gade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a resting place for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Papua ( O@@ PM ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by pushing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who each can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
economic ine@@ qualities have grown over time between the native Papua and the new immigrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions in reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report of Indonesia &apos;s most troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa ref@@ using and a black@@ list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in the session but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Papua states that they will probably not be voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people involved in Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants Jok@@ ov@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blame &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly against the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the Tor@@ ch &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee out of the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches @-@ tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outside areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the outer covering for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport , Davis Cup single , was only to be played on two sets of profit , waf@@ ted thin@@ ly not by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the very long , but also therefore very much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will continue to work to improve the application .
it was not until the vote that , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had come to replace the final on a neutral location .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers take forbidden objects in the plane , find out a pol@@ l
a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent were deliberately smu@@ g@@ gled to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally bore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered bel@@ at@@ edly that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet Charter Service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
those surv@@ eyed admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X .
the most common objects that were purpos@@ efully dropped by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported that know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the plane .
the company said it had asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who most often have smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly the most frequently .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , it has so far suggested that some of the customers have already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k for the first time betra@@ yed another , less da@@ zzling figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that these are non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Transfer . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are ring@@ ing , including mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la &apos;s boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
it is expected that all models will be taken together in 2018 - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are available per day .
who orders a Model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never tested production lines without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , then the non@@ com@@ mitt@@ ment of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt rec@@ edes account of dela@@ ying Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state @-@ owned environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
it is a deadline that went off for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 Standards for O@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regulations which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operate with states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to adhere to dead@@ lines and then wait to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in legal regulation and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s statement said that at some point he will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who su@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset to health and the safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ it@@ t &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to keep this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cruci@@ fixi@@ on of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Government , to tackle environmental pol@@ lu@@ sion@@ ers and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , a Ser@@ en@@ ade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martin@@ i emphas@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Original@@ titel : count Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , besides the former parish church , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged , and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the village image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement core of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 under@@ line this historical situation .
the pat@@ ron@@ age right originated from early medieval property rights .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two were broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were inserted and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius grav@@ ey@@ ard also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the present tower of the tower remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius system from the &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organisers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old grav@@ ey@@ ard to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the final word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the programme starts at 4 : 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
a trunk in front of the cemetery takes place at the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers are providing fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance to Tum@@ our and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Martin@@ i re@@ affir@@ ms .
Verein für permission von Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ dern probe
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resist@@ s Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us &quot; of the landscape .
a few days ago , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use a second wind force concentration zone at the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette &quot; - but which had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf due to a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to enter the wind concentr@@ ation@@ area at the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette &quot; ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle is confir@@ ming the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received throughout the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect the process to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are area .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - that is roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one horrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ Wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in death .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car carried the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; city and retailers plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend &quot; &quot; &quot;
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the residents to the city centre .
as the president of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should raise awareness of the customers who offer their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the local area .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , Christian König .
municipal administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the business association and the city go to a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ appointed Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ving of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven up the inner city - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread in part , and the king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the nationwide third &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thür@@ inger cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the initiative under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

Tr@@ ump put pressure on the trans@@ vers@@ ed tran@@ scripts of telephone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to urged him to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President bu@@ cked him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees , who emig@@ rated to Australia , was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists hold rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ stri@@ pe @-@ suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cry broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience found a real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists came back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were killed by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organisation of the reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , pos@@ ing serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays down a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ da on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding Coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but none was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free footh@@ old for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people in Georgia to vote their vote in the summer for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI the black color guard Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , fell down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white Land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they got closer to the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more form@@ id@@ able .
&quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descrip@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is based on a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that it does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and look even harder away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - entered a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overall view of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ mus , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , fur@@ ious , that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cona returns the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ mus .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship is replacing the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ mus says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos; sad@@ ness &apos; St@@ range Fruit . &apos;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen spectators caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the street .
they have experienced Georgi@@ ans for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to that point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the ly@@ n@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song finish , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse name .
children sit at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit played by the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ mus hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the pos@@ ing with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words , which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding his table at his table , eating and remember@@ ing the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is somehow inspired , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the Wagner &apos;s in Bay@@ reuth &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sets out on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with Mauer@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ pf@@ enni@@ als pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
pil@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which goes through its &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ pf@@ daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .

brut@@ ally the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe on it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are being celebrated stor@@ m@@ ily , who hum@@ bles himself and bends the hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors were eag@@ erly awaited .
in 2013 , he had to let go of a violin conc@@ erto , five years later , there were great ju@@ bil@@ ations in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of their view grew .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked on the school already in an open day .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that happen ?
quantity : I did Abit@@ ur .
and then a civil engineer studies , let &apos;s say successfully .
I recognized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
get a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon service .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one repeat@@ ed@@ ely has other people who have a completely different story behind each other .
whether a refugee or a young man coming out of the family - one always has to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure on which the company is confronted .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early in 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs .
in a third cost reduction programme , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to € 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed on suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured , declared a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby an@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ bers killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban claimed they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the city center killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led forces pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering raising the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to regulate the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency due to the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it is showing the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to measure the o@@ zone provisions - in which in part of the country should be measured pollut@@ ant emissions , in order to specify where inc@@ isions have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 most democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , should boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of the Democrats and conservation groups , worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reducing lung function and increasing respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ x win@@ king decides to set up a common room in the future residential housing estate .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although the area is still owned by the church community until now , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council have suspended such a common room not as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ - just living , but openly into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , is missed by funding opportunities .
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposed resolution looks to signal the investor that in this respect neither saddle - what is le@@ aning against the environment @-@ building - as well as pulse roof - which reduces the pitch and makes construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer doesn &apos;t mean this addition .
when it helps , he passes the committee unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of his own buildings with which one does not get so well ahead , but now they lean to the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but I get a real counterpart , which is market@@ able in doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
three pro@@ pon@@ ents will be given to Sta@@ y &apos;s request to split the resolution accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we make the decision so we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is hur@@ led on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured .
as the police took part , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a car driver travelling in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car who controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ tage car .
Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game play against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match for the new season .
seven pros are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) the personnel care of the German football record champion Bavaria Munich is getting bigger and bigger at the Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce the B@@ V@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has made responsible for the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights is captiv@@ ating the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
wander@@ ing in the Har@@ z from Stern to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deri@@ ves from the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to chart along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry Come to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the tables should be supplemented by the internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception is important when choosing a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star path is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star trail , the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is far more distant .
you will also find in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when to see it best .
since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the German Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with bare eye can be seen clearly .
in the university town of Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ light - the planet path since 2003 on the initiative of the Sup@@ porting Society Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail connects with its stel@@ ae up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the down@@ point degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a diameter of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away .
the entire distance of the planetary distance is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the fle@@ ur to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both com@@ bat@@ ants are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former im@@ balance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down on lightweight .
and he has to move on light wei@@ ght@@ lers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it was to be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all the fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought of the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four Ver@@ sions to Ty@@ re Pi@@ cker
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was losing control over his vehicle just before the end of the market , just before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left driving stre@@ ak could be passed by the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes to improve the defensive formation in Au@@ e points after 2 : 2 at the start of the season against Braunschweig .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as the two opponents would not have been against Br@@ uns@@ wick at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s defense player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ dimensional chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a kick @-@ off doesn &apos;t want to catch up the run@@ es any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be so for the future that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ hand chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just been in the three @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we do not afford to make so many play@@ able mistakes in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failure of a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand at four points on Sunday and be able to concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good start of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judge the start into the season after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim was canc@@ eled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her since they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a fan of ascen@@ sion in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know where they are at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland leave the Rhin@@ eland as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , only because we have the right to get under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine matches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una &apos;s executive coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum seekers assessment tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the assessment of old age during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration Panel ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , migration @-@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
in May the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age evaluation , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see whether they sooner or later go through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot confi@@ dently say , we should not do that as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of concei@@ ving a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renovation needed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has meanwhile come to the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges carry over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and twelve , respectively , 10.@@ 60 metres long .
on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has received 1.@@ 30m wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a marginal fixing , which is also used as an operating path .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is going to run .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
particular attention to detail has required the laying of lines through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable connected to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the work , the residents were informed about the project by hand@@ outs .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bridge groups amount to 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it &apos;s not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is difficult to get under a hat .
the political parties represented in the District Day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites Ron@@ dell to the poster &quot; Great Elec@@ toral Com@@ bat . &quot;
and well @-@ known names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the German elections on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the City @-@ Pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and therefore right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ anium potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel , he made an effort to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us Church there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ ero is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : at about 20 o &apos;clock on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band provides entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chair@@ person Uwe boy .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ bel , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the police had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but there is also a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; applies to classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo guitar player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only exceed the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ ger N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games mix together to form a fascinating total art work .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and they will eat it to the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart said openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I had taken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always lived du@@ alism and believed in it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I have never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; she suffered most notably in the school time , as she dressed like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me some than@@ kl@@ ess , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I &apos;ll tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds out that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would prevent us from working to make our country magnificent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , im@@ pending message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as a clear ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF con@@ gresses on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in gold and silver med@@ als during competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF has voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do all possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , told re@@ porters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ itu@@ ary for soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cut off in Mali &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 1000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained crash of the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two reverse pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took their leave .
after that the mour@@ ning ceremony began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branches of mour@@ ning lay down , and the families were arm in arm in the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ anic soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann installed the flight operation of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew couldn &apos;t turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show minister of the Le@@ yen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are paid , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this is what the Royal House shared on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is added to the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral Church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband , and continued to publish it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also called the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ inc@@ ture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish roy@@ alty .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he worked for over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people had always been flo@@ ated , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik spoke about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was stag@@ gering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ uts instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the parliament &apos;s resolution was resolved on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in Lower Saxony pushed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament against the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ests justified her step with the non nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his group to recommend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be voted regularly on January 14th next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the State Parliament withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be examined legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described himself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that they have returned to their country of land , which they received via the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret El@@ ke T@@ ests &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxon Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social Demo@@ crat on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .
the Austr@@ o @-@ West will cost the majority of Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last vanity and frustr@@ ated their personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U faction head Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the result of the 2013 Land@@ tag elections with personal career .
the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest force in front of the SPD , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information on the infected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all that we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics ?
food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has opened without delay and since becoming acquainted with Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same effect as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and health @-@ safe .
if the residual water level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded on eggs , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , the factories are not to blame .
are manufacturing enterprises and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production plants do not make any immediate debt .
on the contrary , due to alleged illegal practices of service companies , they have to reck@@ on with economic damages .
as always , there are too little controllers in the case of an emergency .
is it missing only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a clear statement that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular Alar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to obtain safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the pan@@ de@@ mic means manufacturers , dealers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide &apos;s fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ sustain@@ ing animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts are resolved quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the football rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded spending of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the wealthy rule family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must counter with legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their business related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P @-@ publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen into dis@@ favor by the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to dis@@ courage excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales revenues for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as a legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar was about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup Ambass@@ adors will be easily able to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to consider any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Kat@@ ars the latter ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Tur@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new energy supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made on @-@ board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott also confirmed a report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request of the news agency from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current plans , the airline will termin@@ ate a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white @-@ packed cho@@ col@@ ates distribute to 14 grams each year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a sho@@ emaker , it is a prestigious order .
the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y how many applicants are in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
the Swiss have been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life led to the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y two and a half years ago .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the First Class customers will be spo@@ ilt with treats from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in the business class nas@@ chen passengers &apos; Scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class , is also being distributed on the short course .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV revol@@ ved ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels like time scar@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for speaking tin vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by insi@@ sting on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who grow up - they still managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering hole principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That Sc@@ ots the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point there is a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline skating and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy vi@@ cious plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons under the mou@@ sta@@ che of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose ex @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is meanwhile reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a severely sc@@ ot@@ tered Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited to a smaller length , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for a nest .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police hit the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
the authorities also ensured greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
at the time of the same raid in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the promotion .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the great effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigations focused primarily on Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the account of the gang .
fashion lam@@ ents big gaps in the for@@ eigner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the deleg@@ ate for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to serious wrong decisions in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , warned in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) .
according to the data , 10 million people with foreign citizenship are reported to the Register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by around 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because data has not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow down return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who don &apos;t have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but such false assur@@ ances led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient , &quot; says it in analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the paper that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , the state can send it back to the immigration country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the capacity for families with children under age in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ t@@ HR ) considers these commitments adequately . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other EU states would send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing parliamentary group , U@@ lla Yel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a danger to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who received awards on Friday .
above all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now donated 50 litres of blood to his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s brilliant how our body is laid out for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the District Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher because the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn @-@ makers reported about the actions that were carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of atten@@ de@@ es a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rel were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 performed blood donations .
half as many booked Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter sold 500 milli@@ liters of their life @-@ juice ten times per 500 milli@@ liter .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the speculation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members to climb this month because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly assessment report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and 1.6 % for 2018 and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in fall .
but it sign@@ alised that in the coming years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation pre@@ heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that bor@@ rowing costs may have to rise more than expected at the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus , which was issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to de@@ grade consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forec@@ asted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound rather fell compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to change after the recent disap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations for an increase in earnings and the GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will easily recover after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor enh@@ ancements , as the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent income from income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but added that wages will recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
the inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that exceeding the threshold of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in the Swa@@ p install@@ ments , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again since the len@@ ders are lou@@ dly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages will complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be 10,000 people in controversial HIV drug
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight against the high Court for the financing of the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic , initiated prior to intercourse , can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now provided by the Health Service for a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling of the Supreme Court , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should fund him .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection .
pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medication is present in a person &apos;s body to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours prior to intercourse .
those who question the treatment are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable candidates will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered by a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence that is used and implemented in a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is conducted quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society one step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
live life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , grew from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window to another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very important , so when you push the door , it &apos;s very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time using high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and are helping to create an emotional attachment to a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from something standard to something amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation over one of the biggest real estate imperialist of Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to split their property and business assets .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property is worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions suggested by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affir@@ m@@ ative in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul affir@@ med , ruled him out .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions compet@@ ently .
in an early affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ eps of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S states that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very reluct@@ ant , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L and after a biography from 2015 , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media received contact with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ters Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with senior officials on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he wanted to fix : bad news that got into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly told the employees that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television extends decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that were convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg against Politi@@ co in February . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping the Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter habit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we do not know - that m@@ umps of twe@@ ets would have contained more combus@@ ti@@ bles without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t send .
if his employees have managed to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him several times , then their efforts have paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump Kontro@@ ver@@ sen .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the superi@@ ority of the advis@@ ers to indu@@ ce du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former dump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he stiff@@ ens to find out wh@@ ence these originate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ing Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the dump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe sends ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoping and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences have shown that many fle@@ ets hide from vacation destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online applications could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the base of the war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn up by the community in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were ki@@ cked out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug out by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ ging residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must act in action by shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved forward and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably today even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect her parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers only to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Soli@@ hull &apos;s spokesperson said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls Police . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective lodging , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been construction sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when entering the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work will take place .
the floors were torn down , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewel out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer says .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly what is needed after the amount of investment .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
the Panel filmed the work in the past few weeks and wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the persons involved .
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N station reported that there are already the first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between the b@@ umps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to specifically interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign .
he investig@@ ates whether there was an agreement between the election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ors to the Republi@@ cans during the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more dr@@ umps in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Agent sent Tr@@ ump into the center in person and accused the accus@@ ation whether the president might have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Jury &apos;s main task is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to collect charges .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called prosecution .
most of the time they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office to sum@@ mon individuals to take part under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting were called to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. was also Tr@@ ump Ad@@ visor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his team leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the translation show that Mu@@ eller doesn &apos;t let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the suspension of the board is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House favor@@ s any action that expe@@ di@@ ted the work of the special promot@@ er in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he will not be determined against the President .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became lou@@ der , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the former National Security Ad@@ visor , Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure on account of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss .
unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bills on Thursday that the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : huge ic@@ e@@ berg in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research shared this on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs about a tri@@ l@@ lion ton heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual breaks of ice stu@@ ff@@ ing in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the broken Col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ven .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was the balance of wa@@ xes and breaking down some years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete shelf of sciss@@ ors .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key site .
melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice the ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it regularly breaks off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and no direct link to climate change is concerned , the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most widespread withdrawal since the record begins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall back in the long run , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead to climate change in the midst of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg , there have been a lot of ice r@@ hy@@ mes in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula during the past few decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to this decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus t@@ ames the areas in which the temperature rises at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the District Day has broken 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 apprenti@@ ces once again have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously highly sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann county .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
according to the wishes of the parties , the management should develop &quot; a concept for human resources and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage , that is to say .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one previously did not know .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a ver@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees who reti@@ re from the service due to illness or age .
so it is high time for action so that no more vac@@ ancies remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he was already in the working @-@ day for a big surprise when he publicly questioned the app@@ rais@@ al of personnel costs and stun@@ ned the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want to check all opportunities that allow a exit from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the administrative office with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should seek a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U is trying to better pay the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently stipul@@ ated exactly , increases or more money only exist if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Regional Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone towards NGO migrant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had effectively worked with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express himself in detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes ding@@ h@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of obsc@@ uring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have , above all , an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with local may@@ ors bear fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin &apos;s out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and Sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
observation points followed , partly on towers , of which one could look far over the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were again and again longer climbs , for which long tri@@ ads were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the look@@ out spot on the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges bring welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed in the open @-@ air inhal@@ er healing Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres of altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best site - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga rein@@ forces itself for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing in the event of wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high numbers included .
this has also been recognised by the first federal government agencies , who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport division in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure that there are still some clubs coming up on this train . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup organised the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now consul@@ ted an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must deal specifically with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that the young people will also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA were challenged at the level of competition .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport in general ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been dealing with the question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it &apos;s competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , ac@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
this is little for the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te consultants write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting suppliers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football league associations , according to D@@ utt , are now required to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times isn &apos;t enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it that only in football everything remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to commit suicide because of the texts Con@@ rad Roy had committed suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward @-@ facing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he didn &apos;t find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , which said that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day at which I do not enter the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I am with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn the generator on and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup is not by chance .
the FC Bayern th@@ rows a big season to the fed @-@ cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that was Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , obviously no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not adverti@@ se it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the objection could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could hint to Kim@@ me as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f consisting of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of vacation professionals , but he .
sugar is the best way to distribute the sweet@@ ness of sugar to those you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to compete in Lah@@ m &apos;s heritage can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ ck@@ ered over the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ eness .
right at the back , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest .
and in general , Kim@@ me worked in this starting formation as the one who can take the ru@@ dder best in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ recorded trou@@ pe .
he had the view for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
V@@ idal therefore , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( folding barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on the devil come out on the achievements of the Asia trip ( folded also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not fall negative in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ ver ran alongside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acting confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm proved to be difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ ver tried a couple of times successfully in the game design .
his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mits that the outcome was &quot; not the way we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed proper performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , gave not one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but definitely six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me said goodbye to a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ ver an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria , you just have to win each game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one any more .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ sem@@ a Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time bl@@ amed the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing picks up the desires of the economy which Lem@@ ke has been blocking all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes to establish a plan for planning , until 2021 will be the right to construction .
the western part of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Road of Transport .
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
of course , nat@@ us sees it as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive enterprises .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier asp@@ ires to develop a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sack@@ ed for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce praised the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Crafts , Trier , sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master test and 2500 euros if graduates make their own self @-@ training within ten years of their master training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time lack the land at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
of 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ run mobility , 29 positions have been occupied so far .
the Chamber of Industry is calling for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U vice @-@ president , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sober@@ ing is also the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ downs .
E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , former Minister for Economic Affairs , is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she moved back to the field after four months due to in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a reaction @-@ reaction
one day prior to the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chairman said the company was saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thereby applied to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - forbi@@ ds or restric@@ ts diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust f@@ umes emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles also makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plot@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistake of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but on normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation would seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer has dispro@@ portion@@ ately contributed to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if it &apos;s time to go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building department wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large amount of information .
it shows a garbage dump .
the start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a worthy wilderness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft drove across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the laughter against the suffering &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon dra@@ fts@@ men , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ er still draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he still sits on the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day .
via cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to be widely spread all over the world .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ fold .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film will talk to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced verb@@ ati@@ m .
Lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of diseases borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in the spring brought much less rain and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ cade , a micro@@ bacterial , that tran@@ sm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ads , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much emphasis on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the small town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet with Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal pains suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or car@@ tels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ed up throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ pha@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the &quot; Justice &quot; building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special investigation was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put to trial .
at Co@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is still tra@@ itors .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce , was broken by the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival car@@ tel fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without pushing for the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish tough investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the founding of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &quot; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you consider as journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ jo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to escape like a port worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do the best of her work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells incor@@ rectly , stay away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is happening with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an district .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers whom the governor described himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce has written three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everybody knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian ruling the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were recently accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ality , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few months earlier , readers would have viewed the Val@@ dez column as the best informed sources of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few notes and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
in the whole country journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and an equally valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the media guard group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists from the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that was said to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kar@@ tell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible n@@ ash@@ ore of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they even could find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has star@@ tled researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ shine M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of sight of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature can be seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better blend into his surroundings and do@@ dge his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life , including his preserved bow@@ el content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with ser@@ rated skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you play only a little with your eyes , you might almost believe he &apos;s sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sun@@ k after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ shine M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were resting on his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater coverage of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ to &apos; .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age to A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are many wounded , long @-@ long stems - and G@@ aff@@ er .
about 20 people were injured on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , there were almost thirty vehicles between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) .
at first there were no information about the exact number of the injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large bid on rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
a ten @-@ kilometre retreat was formed in the direction of Munich .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , there were also massive disabilities on the counter @-@ track - through numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire department noted the characteristics of the car makers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident happened on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing susp@@ ects you sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : exhaust .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the road map control .
it is simply confirmed by a mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
a test run is currently running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes up , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway nar@@ rator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ticket de@@ valuation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without creating she@@ a@@ thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased through the App of the Rail , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket reservation anyway .
and finally , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , invo@@ ke his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat position Y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant will simply check out the DB navig@@ ator himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Chief Marketing Officer of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that besides delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because of@@ ten@@ times you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to assign is missing .
the result is endless discussions between passenger and passenger , resulting in a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of one &apos;s ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other mer@@ gers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on August 9 , 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to her core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment she rented in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continually saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of police tape and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father wearing a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a police officer stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman acknowledged his rif@@ le and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the age of 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell came to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who wore a flo@@ wery dress and a fitting crown , the two spoke a conversation that she had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the black experience and the black state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember , how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to get rid of ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism she is not different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt Ins@@ assen .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell to the project , together with six other natives , the &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; team followed in the years following Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for that is how I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos; history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement that after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media are identified as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ sed type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not by chance , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , F@@ erg@@ uson news cameras have long disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking an auto@@ bahn during a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV reader discuss about bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone sp@@ li@@ ts the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic can hardly be cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It would be real great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while advoc@@ ates build a gallery to attract more customers into the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers sell their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will come to an end .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - with the possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping in the farmer &apos;s market almost every week for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women again and again very willingly .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the shopping center in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough of them in our city .
one can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced competi@@ tively .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by bigger companies , because the rent is often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the farmer &apos;s market going to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to disp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , that seem almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison in Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st f@@ aded a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after publicly decl@@ aring diplomatic messages on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a fitting simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , a sharp albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette stu@@ bs and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal bri@@ ph@@ ews , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a cartoon called &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would convert judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump is running a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid sp@@ li@@ ts he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with her over@@ sized signature under it ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand meters of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in organic terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she shows up with a hands @-@ on @-@ fly in his hand from the disciplinary powers of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put your speech in cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who came from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as fores@@ ighted in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of murder
a country@@ wide chase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are sought to susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the events , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bin , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that it should now be assessed and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal investigation that is being investigated by the relevant authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to set himself up .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ KA@@ D ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and has recently been published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , there is nothing that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has acknowledged a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ martial at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and prescri@@ p@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping scandal of WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ KA@@ D ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di no longer sells her eggs
the company groups shared this with them .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could be further excluded from any health impairment , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative for fi@@ pron@@ il@@ bla@@ sting anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted your employees to compete with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little help or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the trial .
&quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide specialist groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which leaders have low levels of approval - so that you can re@@ bo@@ ve why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the fin@@ anz@@ tech website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
recently , U@@ ber has registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent Enterprise enables tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys to collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that staff can report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has employed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously were hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ s - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ic , value and employee engagement in 2002 , after accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry ble@@ aching online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the total capital to $ 47 million .
gli@@ tz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more likely to expect from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only ins@@ ets .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more obliged to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of staff , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company take no action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 inspiration , you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , employees will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really belong to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , has been able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better attachment of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new practice areas of the team enter@@ tain on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the 3 hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ a &apos;s six seasons in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 pre @-@ formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the regulation change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the player &apos;s busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they move on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task in view of the clear sigh@@ ting of its fields from an adjacent parking area and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been planted with foot@@ balls that sp@@ li@@ ts a grid behind a door@@ pole .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far up to think that people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking place 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have a plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts questioning in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit warnings from third parties and then show their results below their original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ t@@ checks that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the insight that stories of fac@@ tual reviews are challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Stur@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ oni May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time they lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) it seems all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape pla@@ gues , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years ago in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se himself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they are connected with each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher that the Dar@@ rell hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell staged from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a guest , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rell men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ lady . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the closure of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer band since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website that was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f &apos;s citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , that is to say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an omni@@ present promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they compete with other municipalities .
the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a middle five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week as well .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the He@@ ads of State , we now also attended the five vice @-@ pres@@ idents , as well as the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers .
this was the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government forces the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt , this week was negotiated in Ankara .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; fully clean@@ se &quot; the armed forces .
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ba@@ il@@ out ban for female soldiers , the paper wrote .
in any case , the large @-@ scale teaching of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan issued another 73@@ 95 civil servants , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the lords of the country .
three times they challenged their role as a gu@@ ardian of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform targets of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an especially non @-@ named officer who sought asylum from persecution abroad after the coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that happens , NATO could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say S &amp; D diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by spending the way US citizens out of other countries green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate road for race shuttle
over the past few months the future of the race shuttle has been cont@@ ested again and again - now it should go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist railway is going to be built is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race shuttle , construction work on the track will begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , Secretary of State , on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route resulted in some 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operators agree on the technical details already agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the course of a pilot plant in the past few months , it has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also partially strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are at the moment a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of it , but the companies are delivering a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when publishing his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye color to the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows , for example , its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step down to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one the most .
on its website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origin and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something more dun@@ less and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission to an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R will notice its rising popularity , they remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been bo@@ asting to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the po@@ ised eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they can &apos;t separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are compl@@ ac@@ ent slaves .
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ era of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US voters also have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of b@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all preten@@ ding to blow our filter bags out .
less noticeable is the power of m@@ umps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ le@@ aning poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom they had fought for decades because of politics suddenly and completely strange on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y way that one day his mo@@ ths will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself trapped by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the dec@@ eption - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in fact found to be a very mild crime .
when tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be only mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable enhancement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are sc@@ ur@@ ry and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the music @-@ per@@ ating music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a stran@@ gely magical experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor lady in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ ins@@ ing while I was tired of having the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts that he suffered from prison officials after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced for murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first dead belt .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he had his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der hiding inside the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , from which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; National Prosec@@ ution Service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ class students from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the vac@@ ations and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken farm , but then is released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken farm a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain and swa@@ yed .
after that , classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ cking , the cylinders wore to bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young animal is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished everyone four @-@ year @-@ old to feel accepted in his new school .
it was followed by thanks to the colleagues , former school leader Michael Müller , who always jumps into teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks and the parents of the parents .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber @-@ time is over now , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she left her students very reluct@@ ant , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the qu@@ ads .
at the end all students could hear a song from summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ class water@@ courses have already been registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television , announced .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camp@@ ed people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while at the moment an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place considerable fin@@ es to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said the Court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Car Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the power @-@ drive federal office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet an exact date .
Daimler has announced that it is possible to write to each person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the framework .
how long will the change@@ over take place altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to tell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ al@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advised to wait .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , such as S@@ met@@ al@@ anine .
does a massive decline in the price of Euro 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where the prohi@@ bitions threaten .
in rural areas , there have been no loss of value for older diesel .
the ace advises to wait for a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards by the renowned Kennedy Center .
this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 95 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the ceremony .
the winner Le@@ ar , which has been announced with progressive TV series , already announced that he would refrain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to ev@@ ade them - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will take advantage of the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her vision clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to retirement next year .
the job is already written out - however suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he teaches in the press conference .
he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time to famili@@ ari@@ ze with the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach acts as a shelter for the administrative community , the applicant has to assign corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity of the citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good spirits between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot has been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only the latter will book with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a lot of le@@ e@@ way for a city building master .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and nur@@ turing plant , it is possible to react very flexibly to a lot of things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often appl@@ au@@ ded by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is suitable &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the out@@ going city building master .
in any case , the city building supervis@@ or carries a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .
if you wish to bury Roland W@@ acker , according to the town of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed degree as a diploma engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or with a specialist in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of planning and construction planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , building control planning , basic advertising opportunities , management of urban properties , urban farm with building yard and urban gardening , as well as sub @-@ civil rights authority including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : the southern track is closed
according to the police , the previously unknown do@@ ers had thrown the blue bike from the railway track transfer in the area of Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for them for the night .
near the crime scene , a rose @-@ sho@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lausanne &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or the perpetrators brought themselves in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay and the costs of rail transport , the tra@@ w@@ lers could also get to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum went out , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern route could be run without obstruc@@ tions .
nearly ten people had dropped off Friday morning , two of them entered the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall off , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant digestion .
the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not inv@@ ade the body .
cells that are capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance falls too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and an eating intoler@@ ant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system also s@@ wir@@ ls in people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had not been accommod@@ ated .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they got the L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active ingredient was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. Cru@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. rep@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last high season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impres@@ ses in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho granted that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started at the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the plane manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State , the drawing started but in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Tief@@ schlag for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind whi@@ r@@ led : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only there was no fire of the party headquarters , but no counter @-@ wind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election warri@@ ors .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz from there has been from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
and one by one .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unexpected vice @-@ president of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the state election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on El@@ ke T@@ ests in Lower Saxony to give her mandate back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the violation of the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear for@@ gery of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign leader of the Green Party to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true all at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD voting champion sigh@@ s , when the new Job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , states after the over@@ step of the Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U without his own government majority .
it is the provisional cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the failure began with the un@@ expectedly marked defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comrades were re@@ ass@@ uring at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was the case - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ ern , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party smoothly .
comrades in the weeks afterwards lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ cked up again .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived .
and with him came the next deep beat .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he did pretty much wrong about what to do wrong .
Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival ever since .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the Volkswagen exhau@@ sts and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has been in criticism for quite some time now .
giant survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the covenant in the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not hide his comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised to stabili@@ ze the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because of this , Wei@@ l meets the internal party co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens at the bottom no fault .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades therefore try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as women T@@ ests presents their own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected to parliament on account of her individual as a direct candidate , but has been elected to parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxon Green Party , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters were clear four years ago : people made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who heads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local people III
those who want to renov@@ ate their homes in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday were in sen@@ timent .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been remedi@@ ation areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .
in the area of refur@@ bish@@ ment II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy remained at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote interior development as well , and not only to develop new construction areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe , that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 Euros are from the country , the rest from the community .
how is a remedi@@ ation area being created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue , examine where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is no interest in renov@@ ating .
if necessary , the territorial borders could also be postpon@@ ed .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving residential and working relationships and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the inventory took place only once , within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation project got a questionnaire to fill out .
in November or December , the rules of the association shall take place as soon as possible , so that the refur@@ bish@@ ment can begin in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every municipality has to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .
the aim is to evaluate the urban development and decide when it will be rehabili@@ t@@ ated and to what extent .
the property will then also be registered in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the refur@@ bish@@ ment views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Bo@@ xes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire does not simultaneously form an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - those who come first , first gr@@ ind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos from the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed Z@@ 4 technology both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the White House &apos;s advertising costs cost thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the statements made by the military to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was exhibited next to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin Fire Station and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft .
the White House Military Office requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter hit the South La@@ wn on July 17th for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for travel .
but to demand their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February when the presidential jet was powered in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
as Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House completed 58 exercise sessions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units flew in addition to 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
unit Records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but account for the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is , of course , appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky job
the runner @-@ up of the second tennis league of the Bundes@@ liga ki@@ cks off at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the second tennis league made sense to the reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
right on the rear seats I find the team very good . &quot;
especially imports from the high North provide class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
at the moment the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman is not part of the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) , comes first in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chi@@ lean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo had yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should also be involved in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his victories last Sunday against the Club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ ken@@ z could once again put back into the team .
if it is enough for 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coaching staff at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills up the cad@@ res .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he put his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Congress reviewed some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional prescri@@ p@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US thrust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from the O@@ MV , together with other European companies , are concerned with the construction of the Russian eastern sou@@ ll@@ ings Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at what the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , who reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x hasn &apos;t passed yet .
the three and four ech@@ el@@ ons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kar@@ tell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operate with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .

scroll backwards : the city turns 46 out of the kitchen aid
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ich , assistant director in the field of youth assistance , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is kept out of the house : a cat@@ erer is responsible for this task and delivers fresh g@@ alley refriger@@ ated .
the town operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
there were 28@@ 00 children at the tables last year and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days eat in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the prepared food , add salad , raw vegetables and fruit , portions the meal individually , give away food , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as screening units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital leadership to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power , has also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison for the city as the most economical one , is it from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ tim@@ ers are read@@ ju@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight with around 750 people in the education field , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all the members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are going to run in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credible when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban have published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international hostili@@ ties to an advisory role .
this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ on said a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of registered 3.6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
according to the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who was staying with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 14.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetrators tried to grab the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , but she failed .
the Duo escaped without prey .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union would like to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow , with managers from the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea biscuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; be the first to experience &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s claim to &quot; express concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is concerned with our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we fully recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga likes its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after issuing an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about how N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring near the Catal@@ ans Executive Board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but three years ago the football world was warned by the President of the PS@@ G before this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to subscribe to one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , that will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter dropped and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ rator had intentionally inj@@ ected a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle &apos;s material damage of more than 200 euros .
the Police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , tel : 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for advice .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and then tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au to Le@@ ese .
in the area around Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him on his lane so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an drivers tou@@ red the guard rail .
material damage was created on the passenger car .
the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
the final report on the abuse scandal involving the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he expected from former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chap@@ lain Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ enced Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their mis@@ interpretation of what was happening at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised that in reporting about violence among the dom@@ esti@@ al cats , it was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Regensburg tak@@ eover , no one doub@@ ted that &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ ed@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ ed@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and that &apos;s a round fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ atings were a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the abuse cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take the protection of George R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg to inform lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
in total , 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot;
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by dom@@ ici@@ le masters R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially when emotion@@ ality was high , the punishment for the students could also be more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims inv@@ ari@@ ably under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides relief for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ise of Protection Cy@@ cles near Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students distinguish his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has become more tangible when a domain set musi@@ cally does not produce top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly spoken of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ discovery in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside his sphere of influence .
you may at best repro@@ ach him , learn of it too late or have taken initial indications seriously enough .
the Dom@@ Sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also testi@@ fies to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelli@@ gible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who nour@@ ished the boys regularly with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always moved from children &apos;s grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which sometimes led to rage .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just kn@@ elt out chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also caused ear cow@@ ards and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he gave himself to years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able times , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such ch@@ ast@@ ening methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fying sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are , of course , Bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders if it is not with his acquain@@ tance and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just r@@ ushed upon him .
many people who have never understood him are still eager to work on the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot was reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also involved in any involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the dom@@ ici@@ le .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an afflicted representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was all very embarrass@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who was professionally , to a certain extent , a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student said : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that out of it ... Bu@@ ben more penet@@ rable or clearer or even more open than to their parents , boarding instructors , trust@@ worth@@ iness teachers , etc .
that one talks about sex with him ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up to the students and / or their environment , the report should not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of every co @-@ operation .
thus , he cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to display .
therefore , there is no reason to link his good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the dom@@ esti@@ cated cats , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other counts .
the report also covers incidents of the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir leader of the Cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of the sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and mur@@ der@@ ated and were horri@@ fied , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with whom , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this was , as most witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ Sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims app@@ raised the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even bring positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then back in 1993 .
did George R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut his ears before the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um , which even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the primary school the test sentence will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as testing fin@@ es were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they took possession of a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was hard to estimate also for him , where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the limit was actually exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the prison sentence at schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis claimed it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating past moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times , and not for what was ban@@ ished in the primary school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice .
this is all aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take shelter because all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ining and punishment , such as sla@@ vis@@ ing and pulling the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also kept strictly against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit has shown in the talks with you ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of test punishment also available for speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XVI@@ . , tells from his perspective , there the dom@@ esti@@ al cats played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not by all means that he carried out a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the requirement of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world @-@ tran@@ g institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and sweets alone , you will not be able to resist any great singers and before any success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know George R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic @-@ minded , deeply believing and aff@@ ection@@ ate people , from whom you can not imagine that he could only harm a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former dom@@ esti@@ cated cats today , 23 years after his em@@ ulation , regularly keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until now , that he once was stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to whom she still looks and whom she truly ad@@ ore .
and please , once again quite clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were at the time of the day .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intent behind it is all too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the start @-@ up would command a 93 year old man who has earned great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
