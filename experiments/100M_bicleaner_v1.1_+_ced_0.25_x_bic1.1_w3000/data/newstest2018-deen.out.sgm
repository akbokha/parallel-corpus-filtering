<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your look at the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is excavated.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone who had to get upset about this because the car-Navi was a green meadow instead of a strapping road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and congregations have changed since the 19th century in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" s "" "" sheets have been incorporated for cities and municipalities. "" "</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the early 1800s during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops marched off with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographische Bureau."</seg>
<seg id="19">The fact sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all other documents on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is situated in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and figures appears: hand-written, numbered flurries from the so-called "urine" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots show no farmers there today - but farmers in the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October Festival, was in the 19th century indeed a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Journal sheet, one reads not only the street names "at the Gasteig" or from the "Auf der Lüften" street names in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created there in 1858 / 59." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with King Ludwig II's death.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the accusations of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occupants," "" "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later on 500 places were extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrities in Germany, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural style based on the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn course will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to promote coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination complaints, as well as the state law enforcement authorities, who are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of citizens' rights which happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sander died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the voyage through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Office of Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are halted 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready if they bring deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law, which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws which oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to further race provisioning in the opinion of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholder groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weishaun-Project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac made a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the voting court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insight into his company, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and equally many kittens and houses in five apartments holiday-houses.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests there is only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischbach, he described the fence project as" "" "fundamental" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I can't profit from such steep areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland provision ensures a lot of work, a lot must be dealt with with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "emphasized Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental business and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct bioenergy.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about its leaders." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers must be supported at costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the afforestation of the area could be drafted for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">This means that the area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which cannot be forwarded until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half of the leader was funded, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job without farmers and landladies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss says:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Policy (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area must not be catchy (slope of over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots involving nearly 16 kilometres of fence is currently underway for the Fisherbach electric fence project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-air space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's suggestions for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have killed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus from 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the Statue of Liberty" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your crowded masses, longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who were campaigning to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus also changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservatives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not lighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual, Limbaugh has stumbled upon something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship club will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Their Captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it's "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir goes on this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season, which included victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the Lee McConnell team.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also join the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">Being so special about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me, "she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">Concerning my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion again.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics via Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long before the newspapers hit him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led as sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very smart to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not hateful but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor of the Governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control items or arrest demonstrators and silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sucked by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County passed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington's time, the time of affordable porto had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters hit his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people, carried out by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Those surveyed admitted that they knowingly attempted to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent millennials, compared with less than 15 percent, were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common objects that were purposefully dropped by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent reported that knowingly carried items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it had asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggled goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.</seg>

<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk now admits: 63,000 of the total of 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.</seg>

<seg id="429">However, the Tesla's boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">It is expected that all models will be taken together in 2018 - 500,000 by 2020, one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are available per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders a Model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never tested production lines without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if there are too much delays, then the noncommittment of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the environmental protection authority, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smog caused air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state-owned environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a deadline that went off for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 Standards for Ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"" "Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance of one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" "" "interfere in local decisions or to hinder economic growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was President Donald Trump Attorney General of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed to block or delay regulations which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory roll back agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of EPA to co-operate with states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to adhere to deadlines and then wait to be accused of activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said that at some point he will use his "authority to delay and all other legally available full powers" to ensure that the provisions "are based on sound policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of the States who sued the EPA in this week, said the Group intended to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset to health and the safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog who flows into their communities," "" "said Schneiderman."

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a Serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters of Tumlingen their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasises:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Originaltitel: count Hermann von Sulz "sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, besides the former parish church, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint belonged, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the village image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 underline this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronage right originated from early medieval property rights.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Larger of the two were broken at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the window panes were inserted and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower of the tower remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius system from the "creative pensioners" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers invite the friends and promoters of Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth serenade on the old graveyard to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "asparagus" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days ago, the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use a second wind force concentration zone at the "Boisheimer Nette" - but which had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf due to a lack of form.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - that is roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.</seg>

<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has meanwhile come to the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges carry over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and twelve, respectively, 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">On Wednesday morning, the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has received 1.30m wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal fixing, which is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 m wide bridge is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is going to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular attention to detail has required the laying of lines through the structure in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable connected to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">In the run-up to the work, the residents were informed about the project by handouts.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be fished first.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG must prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the wealthy rule family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but they must counter with legitimate income sources that allow them the break-even point in their business related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP-publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen into disfavor by the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sales revenues for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar was about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar's World Cup Ambassadors will be easily able to find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to consider any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymars transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>

<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon is meanwhile reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a severely scottered Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synced by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Live life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, grew from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "explains Erfan from the reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's very important, so when you push the door, it's very easy to glide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and are helping to create an emotional attachment to a home," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from something standard to something amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation over one of the biggest real estate imperialist of Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to split their property and business assets.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her late father Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin's property is worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions suggested by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affirmative in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul affirmed, ruled him out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions competently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affiridavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, which Colin opened the first jeeps of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS states that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark had paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "Paul" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">The new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporters Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to fix: bad news that got into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television extends decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that were convincing," "" "said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg against Politico in February." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "" "" "politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping the Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that the" "" "Twitter habit" "" "habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we do not know - that mumps of tweets would have contained more combustibles without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees have managed to keep annoyance from him several times, then their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump Kontroversen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the superiority of the advisers to induce dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former dump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he stiffens to find out whence these originate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reining Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to document the dump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1, next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective lodging, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The Panel filmed the work in the past few weeks and wrote the "Wall Street Journal" on appeal to the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN station reported that there are already the first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between the bumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to specifically interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>

<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand who acted as advisors to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller also scrutinized more and more drumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Agent sent Trump into the center in person and accused the accusation whether the president might have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The Grand Jury's main task is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to collect charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to summon individuals to take part under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting were called to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. was also Trump Advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his team leader Paul Manafort during the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "" "" "legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the translation show that Mueller doesn't let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly." ""</seg>

<seg id="1500">However, the suspension of the board is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the history of Russia is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1505">But they usually work in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House favors any action that expedited the work of the special promoter in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he will not be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was first used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rooting, accusations against Trump became louder, he did not want to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June a senate committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure on account of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on by the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>

<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breaks of ice stuffing in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken Colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C Schelven.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was the balance of waxes and breaking down some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete shelf of scissors.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C horseshoe is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key site.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice the ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and no direct link to climate change is concerned, the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most widespread withdrawal since the record begins," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">According to scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelven will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall back in the long run, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead to climate change in the midst of this gigantic iceberg, there have been a lot of ice rhymes in the Antarctic Peninsula during the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus tames the areas in which the temperature rises at the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU asks to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break the District Day has broken 41 new positions in the administration.</seg>

<seg id="1554">Now, 17 apprentices once again have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously highly sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently, there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann county.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">According to the wishes of the parties, the management should develop "a concept for human resources and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage, that is to say.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-climbers and involve a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that one previously did not know.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a veritable" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, a high number of employees who retire from the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it is high time for action so that no more vacancies remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He was already in the working-day for a big surprise when he publicly questioned the appraisal of personnel costs and stunned the other parties.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU is trying to better pay the employees and officials when it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently stipulated exactly, increases or more money only exist if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express himself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of obscuring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport division in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>

<seg id="1633">For Professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it's competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of diseases borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in the spring brought much less rain and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small chiccade, a microbacterial, that transmits dwarf ciads, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper riodoce usually meet with Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal pains suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the bodies are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. 589 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riphace, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the "Justice" building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special investigation was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely put to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Coodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is still traitors.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the Why, we mistrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioodoce, was broken by the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the children, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Rioodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without pushing for the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Feodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award "of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Rijoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to escape like a port worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size Culiacan district.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers whom the governor described himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Rioodoce has written three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, conducting an abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everybody knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician ruling the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>

<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved condition has startled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Sunshine Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of sight of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 Pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this herbivores, although covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better blend into his surroundings and dodge his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by eating meat-eating dinosaurs that the evolution favoured the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Sunshine Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>

<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="2063">Folayan already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt Insassen.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, that seem almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison in Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst faded a 35-year prison sentence after publicly declaring diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called A Becoming resemblance (a fitting similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, a sharp albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts such as cigarette stubs and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal briphews, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a cartoon called "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would convert judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump is running a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid splits he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her oversized signature under it (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand meters of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in organic terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome is not responsible for who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the aforementioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as she shows up with a hands-on-fly in his hand from the disciplinary powers of the United States as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as foresighted in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacles, which gather like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also aimed, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A countrywide chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are sought to suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bites.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the events, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented to restore the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the replacement of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, there is nothing that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>

<seg id="2189">"" "in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutkos's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, leader of the independent Russian Anti-doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales office rmartial at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and prescriptions.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted your employees to compete with your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little help or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the trial.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide specialist groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which leaders have low levels of approval - so that you can rebove why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you will not be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisance in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the finanztech website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Recently, Uber has registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"" "like GLINT, Convercent Enterprise enables tailor-made" "" "pulse" "" "surveys to collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat-maps of your problem areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that staff can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has grasped regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has employed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that previously were hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns - can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethic, value and employee engagement in 2002, after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry bleaching online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service, and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are more likely to expect from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only insets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of staff, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company take no action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4.000 inspiration, you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you don't follow, employees will ask," "" "Habt you really belong to me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, has been able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better attachment of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Sturiewicz, Brioni May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time they lit a fire because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape plagues, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey and started writing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust only received full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "hundreds of years ago in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that represent who possessed something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go its way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse himself in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2316">"" "the Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney:" "" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a guest, always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford." ""</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landlady. "</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of it, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when publishing his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "customize" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows, for example, its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like Frigid Farrah, which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible," enthuses True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step down to Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On its website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and their increasing refinement point to something more dunless and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission to an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR will notice its rising popularity, they remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been boasting to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the poised eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are complacent slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-era of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized US voters also have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of bump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all pretending to blow our filter bags out.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticeable is the power of mumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican kinship, with whom they had fought for decades because of politics suddenly and completely strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the creepy way that one day his moths will no longer be repelled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself trapped by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the deception - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in fact found to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican must be only mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parks department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scurry and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the music-perating music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not just the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowing of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor lady in the department store stood apologetically grinsing while I was tired of having the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for the second time.</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal of the prosecutors against a first dead belt.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he had his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding inside the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say it is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "the" "" "National Prosecution Service" "" "said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder for 31 years.</seg>

<seg id="2539">He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be enough time to familiarize with the regular periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as a shelter for the administrative community, the applicant has to assign corresponding conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity of the citizens is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good spirits between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often applauded by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye on what is suitable" when new buildings are approved, emphasises the outgoing city building master.</seg>
<seg id="2558">In any case, the city building supervisor carries a high level of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is the builder," "" "in the end everything runs over my table." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2561">Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wants: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you wish to bury Roland Wacker, according to the town of Haslach, you should have a completed degree as a diploma engineer or a bachelor with a specialist in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of planning and construction planning.</seg>

<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant digestion.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not invade the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance falls too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and an eating intolerant to tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also swirls in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had not been accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and there were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. Cruteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active ingredient was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. Cruteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. repteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. Cruteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2639">It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The failure began with the unexpectedly marked defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>

<seg id="2646">Comrades in the weeks afterwards laboriously racked up again.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just plucked up new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg arrived.</seg>

<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication he did pretty much wrong about what to do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Scholz has been fighting for his political survival ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Due to the Volkswagen exhausts and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony's Prime Minister has been in criticism for quite some time now.</seg>

<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil tried to set accents in the covenant in the past few weeks.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to renovate their homes in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representative Steg city development on Wednesday were in sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been remediation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the area of refurbishment II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy remained at least 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "success project" - it is important to promote interior development as well, and not only to develop new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 Euros are from the country, the rest from the community.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a remediation area being created?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "you will, as Schindler continue, examine where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is no interest in renovating.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial borders could also be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme" "" "Social City" "", "in which the restructuring would be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the program are the revitalisation of inner cities, improving residential and working relationships and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the inventory took place only once, within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation project got a questionnaire to fill out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the rules of the association shall take place as soon as possible, so that the refurbishment can begin in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every municipality has to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to evaluate the urban development and decide when it will be rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">The property will then also be registered in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will once again come to sensations and make a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that the project was a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a Maine Yacht, a Wisconsin Fire Station and a Mississippi forklift.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy Naval Commander for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter hit the South Lawn on July 17th for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the grass was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal involving the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he expected from former Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerienced Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their misinterpretation of what was happening at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaredia." ""</seg>

<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes:" "" "my brother of the Pope" "" "written with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take the protection of George Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg to inform lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">In total, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen) were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility."</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by domicile masters R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially when emotionality was high, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims invariably underestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides relief for Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence Exercise of Protection Cycles near Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students distinguish his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who has become more tangible when a domain set musically does not produce top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly spoken of any suspicion of complicity or co-discovery in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool took place outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may at best reproach him, learn of it too late or have taken initial indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The DomSpatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also testifies to him as" "" "warm-hearted," "" "" "" "sincere" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "" "and" "" "intelligible" "" "as extremely good-natured teachers, who nourished the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and sweets and" "" "always moved from children's grapes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to rage.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just knelt out chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also caused ear cowards and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he gave himself to years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable times, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such chastening methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrifying sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, they are, of course, Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not with his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still eager to work on the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot was reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also involved in any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the domicile.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said an afflicted representative for the others," "" "I was all very embarrassed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who was professionally, to a certain extent, a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do students evaluate Ratzinger's role with regard to misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that out of it... Buben more penetrable or clearer or even more open than to their parents, boarding instructors, trustworthiness teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks about sex with him... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes:" "" "in the run-up to the students and / or their environment, the report should not be confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of every co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, he cannot be accused of preventing or having brought him to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name to these conflicting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "among the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former domain master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domesticated cats, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other counts.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also covers incidents of the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of the sadistic teachers were properly harassed and murderated and were horrified, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this was, as most witnesses stress, the subject of" "" "primary school" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the DomSpatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and that is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appraised the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even bring positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did George Ratzinger consistently shut his ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which even reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "that in the primary school the test sentence will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as testing fines were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took possession of a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate also for him, where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was actually exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the prison sentence at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "historians are talking about the" "" "pitfalls of achronism" "", "that is, the danger of evaluating past moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times, and not for what was banished in the primary school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am happy that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take shelter because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplining and punishment, such as slavising and pulling the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly against it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My Brother the Pope" "", "which picture of his Regensburger Zeit has shown in the talks with you?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of test punishment also available for speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedikts XVI., tells from his perspective, there the domestial cats played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not by all means that he carried out a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the requirement of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-trang institution, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and sweets alone, you will not be able to resist any great singers and before any success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know George Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic-minded, deeply believing and affectionate people, from whom you can not imagine that he could only harm a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former domesticated cats today, 23 years after his emulation, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until now, that he once was stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.</seg>
